	<h2>Evidence accumulation lab</h2>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>In this lab, we'll discuss how computational models are used in cognitive neuroscience, and we'll look at how one class of models, Drift Diffusion Models, is used to express and test hypotheses about visual perception.
	<h1>Learning goals</h1>
	After this lab you should have a better understanding of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>What models are, and how they are used in cognitive neuroscience</li>
		<li>How drift diffusion models (DDM) work, and what they capture about the decision making</li>
		<li>How to use models to make predictions about behavior</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h1>What is a computational model?</h1>
	<p><b>Computation models</b> are abstract, mathematical descriptions that strip down the thing being described into its essential parts. You already learned about how simple cells, complex cells, and even deep neural networks can be a model for the human visual cortex. Now we want to introduce you to a new kind of model that can be used to help understand decision making. For example, the map of Stanford on your smartphone is a model of the Stanford campus: it gives you essential information about the campus that you need to navigate. Models are useful, first, because they condense complex, messy information into a simpler representation—if your map was instead exactly as large and detailed as the real Stanford campus, it would not help you get to class any faster. The same will be true of our decision making models, we will take complex information and boil it down to the minimum necessary to make a choice.</p>
	<p>You can think of computational models as a mathematical language for expressing theories. In fact, you may have already seen computational models in some of your other classes. For example, in your physics class, you may have seen the following equation used to describe the motion of a cannonball whizzing through the air:
	</p>
	<div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/human-cannonball.jpg"/></div>
	<div id="katex1"></div>
</div>

<div id="block2">
	<div id="katex2"></div>
	<p>We can use this equation to <b>model</b> the height of the cannonball over time. What you'll see below plotted in red is the actual positions of an imaginary cannonball. Your job is going to be to change the <b>parameters</b> of the model to best fit the data. After that we'll be able to <b>interpret</b> the parameters to understand what the cannonball was doing, and what forces were acting upon it.</p>
	<p><b>Hint:</b> whenever we provide code that can be edited, press <b>enter</b> to run the code including changes you made.</p>
	<p><b>Hint:</b> when you see <b>//</b> the rest of the text on that line is ignored. We use this to provide you with <b>comments</b> about the programming problems.</p>
	<textarea id="textarea1" rows="4" onkeypress="textarea1(event,this);">
// Model Paramters: tweak to fit the black line (model) to the data (red)
y0 = 0; // Initial position (m)
vy = 49; // Vertical velocity (m/s)
ay = -9.8; // Vertical acceleration (gravity, m/s^2)</textarea><br>
	<p>The plot below solves the equation for values of t (time) using your parameters from zero to five seconds.</p>
	<div id="plot1"></div><br>
	<p id="leastsquares_visible1">Complete the task to continue!</p>
	<div id="leastsquares_hidden1"><p></p>
		<p>What you just did was use a computational model to attempt to explain a set of data. What you found was that by setting the initial velocity to ~49 m/s and gravity to -9.8 m/s^2 you were able to explain all of the datapoints we observed. An analogous way to say this would be: the cannonball was launched from the cannon, and over time gravity pulled it back to earth.
		<p>Compare that statement to the equation above. What advantages might the computational model have over the verbal model? All models make some simplifying assumptions—what details of the cannonball's trajectory does the equation neglect?</p>
		<p>Computational models are used throughout the sciences to explain and predict complex phenomena, such as the trajectory of a hurricane, the ups and downs of the stock market and, in cognitive neuroscience, the computations perfomed by the 100 billion neurons in your brain. In the remainder of this lab, we'll look at one particular class of models: <b>drift diffusion models</b>.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="block3">
	<h2>What are drift diffusion models (DDMs)?</h2>
	<p>Drift Diffusion Models are a way of modeling rapid, noisy decisions between two alternatives. In class, you saw how these models are used to model some aspects of perception, such as motion detection. You might think that *seeing* is very different from *decision-making*—but, actually, your brain is constantly making split-second decisions to interpret what you are seeing. For example, just think of the many decisions you make while driving: your brain can use information about the motion from other cars to infer whether you are going at the same speed as the other cars, whether you have enough room to change lanes, or how far away you are from your exit.</p>
	<p>In the lab, neuroscientists use much simpler decisions to study how these fast, complex perceptual decisions are made. In class, you saw one such experiment, carried out by Professor William Newsome's lab at Stanford: macaques were shown moving dots on a screen, and they had to decide whether the dots were predominantly moving to the left or to the right. The task was made harder or easier by changing the proportion of dots that were moving in concert:</p>
	<div width="100%" height="150px" style="position:relative; text-align:center">
		<div >25%: Very Difficult<br><canvas width=100 height=100 id="canvas_mot25"></canvas></div>
		<div >50%: Medium Difficult<br><canvas width=100 height=100 id="canvas_mot50"></canvas></div>
		<div >75%: Easy<br><canvas width=100 height=100 id="canvas_mot75"></canvas></div>
	</div><br>
	<p>DDMs describe the macaque's perceptual decision-making, essentially, as a process where evidence is noisily accumulated in favor of one of two alternatives ("left" or "right"). What does it mean to accumulate evidence? Imagine that there is a decider neuron that is counting the "votes" cast by other, motion-detecting neurons. At each timestep, it reads a spike from a neuron that codes either leftward motion (casting one vote for "left") or rightward motion (casting one vote for "right"). This neuron continues to count votes until it accumulates enough evidence for one of the two options and makes its decision. You should have this image in mind, as we saw in lecture:</p>
	<div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/integrator.png"/></div>
	<p>We're going to model this picture in just a moment, but before you go on take a second to really study it. What do we mean by a "right preferring MT population"? This should remind you of last week's lab in which you learned about neurons that have preferences for different visual features, such as oriented bars, or complex features like cats and dogs. The neurons here just happen to prefer <b>rightward motion</b>.
</div>
<div id="block4">
	<h2>Problem #1: Simulating a neural population</h2>
	<p>You've already seen in the first lab how a cell can "see" certain kinds of features, even as complex as a dog or a cat, by building up from less complex features. Here what we're going to have are two <b>populations</b> of neurons that respond to rightward or leftward motion, respectively. Note that these aren't single neurons, we're going to be imagining that this is a set of neurons and that we're reading out the average response. We're going to walk through this in steps, building up from single neurons through to two populations that prefer different motion directions.</p>
	<p>First, take a look at this patch of dots. By clicking on the patch you can change it's direction. If you click and drag the slider bar you'll see the motion coherence (% of dots moving) change. 
	<div width="100%" height="150px" style="position:relative; text-align:center">

			<canvas width=100 height=100 onclick="flip4();" id="motion_patch1"></canvas>

	</div><br>
	<div id="4initial">
	<p>What you see is the response of <b>one</b> neuron to this patch of motion, which we assume is in the neuron's receptive field. Try changing the motion coherence and direction. Notice that the single neuron is slightly variable--this is due to random noise in the firing rate of the neuron. A neuron fires off "spikes" every few milliseconds, and occasionally that rate of firing can fluctuate, causing the noise you see here.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div id="4population">
	<p>Now what you see is the response of <b>many</b> neurons averaged together (the <span style="color:#5DADE2">blue</span> line) and the individual neurons (gray lines). Remember that each of the neurons have some variability in the strength of their responses: this causes the population response to have <b>noise</b>, which you see as the random fluctuations in the average. Notice that the noise in the population average is smaller than the noise across the population. The advantage of using a population response rather than individual neurons is that it reduces noise.
	</div>
	<div id="4lr">
		<p>Finally you now see the response of <i>two populations of neurons</i>, one that prefers <span style="color:#5DADE2">left</span> motion and one that prefers <span style="color:#CD6155">right</span>.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this demonstration was to show how two <b>neural</b> outputs can read out different features from the exact same stimulus. Again, this should remind you of how cats and dogs were separately read out from the stimuli in the first lab. Now, what the drift diffusion model is going to do is use the responses of these two populations of neurons to make a decision about what motion is being shown.</p>
	</div>
	<button class="button" id="continue4" onclick="continue4();">Next</button>
</div>

<div id="block5">
	<h2>Problem #2: Simulating a single decision</h2>
	<p>We now need to describe the drift diffusion model: how do we take two noisy sources of information and combine them to reach a decision.</p>
	<p>To build up our model we're going to imagine that our macaque brain is looking at a motion patch for a few hundred milliseconds. This means that the populations of <span style="color:#5DADE2">left</span> and <span style="color:#CD6155">right</span> preferring neurons will each be activated to some extent at every moment in time. Each population also has noise (as you saw), so it would be a mistake to take the instantenous response of either population as the truth. Instead we will <b>accumulate</b> data over time until we are <b>confident</b>.</p>
	<p>To picture what's happening we're going to show you the same display as before. Again, you can control the coherence and the direction of the motion. But now we're going to add a new plot below which will have: the firing rate of the <span style="color:#5DADE2">left</span> population, <span style="color:#CD6155">right</span> population, and the accumulated evidence in black.</p>
	<p>What do we mean by "accumulated evidence"? Well, intuitively, the evidence at any given moment for left is the firing rate of the left population <b>minus</b> the firing rate of the right population. All we do is sum that up over time, as in this equation:</p>
	<div id="katex3"></div>
	<br>
	<div width="100%" height="150px" style="position:relative; text-align:center">
		<div>
			<h1>Motion sample</h1><canvas width=100 height=100 onclick="flip5();" id="sample"></canvas>

			<input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="25" oninput="updateCoherence5(this.value/100);"/><output id="coherence5">25%</output>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div width=600 id="plot2"></div><br><br>
	<p>There are a few things to note here.
	<ul>
		<li>Even when you put in the same coherence and direction twice, you get slightly different results. This is due to the <b>noise</b></li>
		<li>At a glance, the left and right population responses don't give you much information at all. It's only by summing them up that you can tell what direction the patch is going.</li>
		<li>We still haven't decided how to define that we are <b>confident</b> in the accumulated evidence.</li>
	</ul>
	You could imagine now adding one final step. What if you picked some value, a threshold, of evidence at which you would say you were confident? For example, you could say that if you get to either +20 (left) or -20 (right), then you'll take that decision and use it. This would now give you the ability to use this miniature model to make decisions.</p>
	<p>What we've just shown you is the core of the drift diffusion model: a diffusion rate (the evidence for left minus the evidence for right), the drift rate (noise), and the threshold at which you make your choice. In the next section you're going to write some code to implement the model yourself, and then we'll use it to construct <b>simulations</b>.
</div>

<div id="block6">
	<h2>Problem #2: Simulating a single decision</h2>
	<p>It's now your turn to write some code! The first thing we're going to do is generate the neural population responses for any particular motion patch. We're going to give you two numbers: the coherence of the patch (what % of dots are moving together), and the direction. Your job is going to be to complete two <b>functions</b> that will tell us what the neural population response looks like based on what the neurons are seeing (the coherence and direction). Remember that neurons have some response, but they also have noise. We've written a function <b>randn()</b> that you can use to get random numbers pulled from a normal distribution. Try out randn() here: just press <b>enter</b>, you'll see the output of this function below.
	<textarea rows=1 id="textarea6" onkeypress="textarea6(event);">
out = randn();</textarea>
	<textarea color="red" rows=1 onkeypress="event.preventDefault();" id="output6">Output will appear here</textarea>
	<br>
	<p>Try pressing enter a few more times, you should see that the values you get are being taken from the random normal (gaussian) distribution, centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1. If you're not familiar with normal distributions this is a good time to ask your neighbor, or the TA, to describe how these work.</p>
	<p>Now imagine that we have a motion patch that has some random coherence and direction. We'll store these values in the variables <b>patch_coherence</b> which can go from 0 to 1 and <b>patch_dir</b> which is either 1 (right) or -1 (left). Use these values to fill out the two functions below: leftResponse() and rightResponse(), so that they return the response of the neural population. Remember the response should be some function of the coherence, plus noise, i.e. as in this equation but where F() is a function that you can pick. (It's okay to use the coherence value directly, but keep in mind how large the neural responses are relative to the noise, you may want to add a scaling factor)</p>
	<div id="katex4"></div>
	<textarea rows=25 id="textarea62" onkeypress="textarea62(event);">
//We've set up the function definitions for you
//just fill in the code where we marked it
leftResponse = function(patch_coherence,patch_dir) {
	// Some hints: since this is the left response it should depend on
	// whether the patch is actually going left or right
	// To make things depend on a value you can use a conditional 
	// statement. For example, if you do the following:
	// out = dir>0 ? 1 : 0
	// The english translation is: If dir>0 is true then: 1, otherwise: 0

	// MODIFY THE NEXT LINE
	out = patch_dir>0 ? patch_coherence*2 : 0;
	// The last thing we do is add random noise on this line:
	out = out+randn();

	return out;
}

rightResponse = function(patch_coherence,patch_dir) {
	// MODIFY THE NEXT LINE
	out = patch_dir<0 ? patch_coherence*2 : 0;

	<p>Nice work! You now have two functions leftResponse() and rightResponse() that you'll be able to re-use later. Right now we're going to use them to generate samples like in the graph on the last page. We'll then write one more function to integrate these, and then we'll have our drift-diffusion model!

		<p>How do you think neurons actually respond to increasing motion coherence? Do you think it's linear, non-linear, exponential? Why? When you look at the output on the graph on the next page, try going back to this one and editing your functions to compare linear, exponential, and saturating non-linear functions of coherence. Which do you think is the most realistic? Is there anything in biology that would suggest one solution is more likely than the others? Discuss with your partner and the TA.</p>

	<h2>Problem #2: Simulating a single decision</h2>
	<p>We're missing two more pieces for our drift diffusion model.

	<h2>Problem #3: Simulating many decisions</h2>
	<p>The drift diffusion model is most useful as a <b>simulation</b>. Given some set of parameters: a drift rate, diffusion rate, and threshold, the model will create all sorts of different scenarios for how a particular event might play out. But: on average with any given set of parameters we'll get some number of trials that come out correct <b>hits</b> some number that are incorrect <b>misses</b> and also a piece of information we haven't discussed which is the <b>reaction time</b> on each trial.</p>
	<p>The first thing we'll do in this section is model a hundred trials and just look at the variability in results that we get. Try tweaking the evidence for left or right motion, changing the amount of noise, or changing the thresholds, you'll see the output change each time you change the parameters. Press enter in the input box to re-run the model.</p>

	<div width=600 id="plot8"></div>
	<p>What should be apparent from this simulation is that different diffusion, drift, and threshold parameters can fit all kinds of sets of data (hits, misses, RTs). Just like early on when we <i>fit</i> the quadratic model to a set of data, here you can also tweak the parameters to fit them to a particular set of data. What this gives us then are parameters that are <b>interpretable</b>. What does a hit rate really mean? Not necessarily that much, but what about a drift rate? It's possible that there are direct neural correlates to the drift diffusion model parameters. In other words, if we record from the brain can we find neurons that actually appear to be computing drift diffusion while we make decisions? It turns out there are! In the last section we'll look at real recordings from macaque neurons in the lateral intraparietal area and as you'll see we will be able to model them quite well using the drift diffusion model.</p> 
</div>

<div id="block9">
	<h2>Problem #4: Fitting to data</h2>
	<p>In the following image we're going to show you real data recorded from 56 neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP). It's thought that LIP acts as an accumulator of evidence when making decision about direction of motion. The graph is set up similar to how we've shown it before--time is on the X axis but now firing rate is on the Y axis. The hypothesis is that firing rate is representing the <b>accumulated evidence</b> at any given moment in time. We're going to fit a drift diffusion model to see whether the model captures the variance in the data, and if so we'll consider that evidence that the hypothesis might be correct.</p>
	<p>The solid lines are from correct trials and dashed lines were incorrect, and each condition was averaged across left and right motion. Notice that the lines break out by motion coherence just as you might expect: stronger motion coherence causes firing rates to peak more quickly.</p>

	<br>
	<p>The final step of our tutorial today is going to be to try to fit a drift diffusion model to this data. Like before we're going to let you define how the drift rate, diffusion rate, and threshold, might vary as a function of the motion coherence on each trial. As output we'll show you the data from this graph compared to the average output of 56 trials of your drift diffusion model. Your goal, just like in the cannonball example, is to minimize the difference between the model output and the data. At the end we'll look at the model parameters that you produced and discuss how you would <b>interpret</b> these.</p>
