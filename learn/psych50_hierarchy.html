	<h2>Simple cells, complex cells, and deep neural networks</h2>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

	<p>In this lab we will be exploring some of the details of the simple and complex cells which we learned about in lecture. You will be running some example code which will show you how different cells “see” the world and eventually using a deep neural network similar to those that Facebook, Google, Tesla, and Apple are using to identify you in your images, control their driverless cars, and understand your voice when you ask your phone for information.</p>

	<h1 id="learninggoals">Learning goals</h1>

	<p>After this lab you should have a better understanding of the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How simple and complex cells act as filters, only detecting a certain pattern of information. </li>
	<li>How representations in the cortical visual hierarchy become more complex as you proceed deeper through cortical areas.</li>
	<li>Be able to explain why invariance is an important property to have in the highest levels of visual cortex.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 id="sectionlabs">Lab sections in Psych 50</h1>

	<p>This is our first section in Psych 50 so we want to take a brief moment to orient you to how these <b>lab tutorials</b> work. Your TA probably aleady mentioned that we will have a mixture of open discussions, demonstrations, and lab tutorials. The lab tutorials are an introduction to <b>computation models</b> as a tool for understanding the brain, and we use programming to run our models(in this case <i>javascript</i>, which runs on webpages). You'll get the most out of these labs if you work together with a partner and discuss what's happening at each step. You may want to use a whiteboard or pen/paper to go over key ideas along the way. In today's lab you'll just be going through examples that we've made for you, but in future labs you will have to write some parts of the computational models yourself. We don't expect you to learn to program during this class but we do expect you to (1) learn the computational models presented in lab, and (2) understand the value of programming as a tool to understand the brain. Let your TA know if you have questions!</p>

	<p>If you already know how to program you will find bonus content sprinkled throughout the tutorials, usually at the end. None of this content will be required but it will help you get a more in-depth understanding of what's happening behind the scenes.</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>How do neurons in visual cortex see the world? This is a much more complex question than you might think. Neurons in visual cortex actually embody very complex computations and the visual features they are sensitive to turn out to be quite complex. But--over the years researchers have discovered that part of that complexity comes from the hierarchical organization of visual cortex. In this lab we're going to focus on this core question: how do simple computations repeated in a hierarchical manner create complex feature detectors? As we go along through the tutorial the answer should become more and more concrete.<p>
	<p>Before we go on we want to mention three important vocabulary terms that we will repeat throughout this tutorial:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Neural activation</b>: a neuron can be <b>excited</b> or <b>inhibited</b>, above or below its baseline firing rate. We usually assume that most of a visual cortex neuron's activity is due to features in its receptive field.</li>
		<li><b>Features</b>: a feature is an aspect of the visual world, like luminance, edges, color, or the presence of an object or animal.</li>
		<li><b>Receptive field</b>: the area of visual space a neuron is sensitive to, i.e. "what the neuron sees", some parts may be excitatory, some may be inhibotry</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>Now we're going to go back in time a bit. First to 1953 to see how Stephen Kuffler studied <i>retinal ganglion cells</i>, then to 1962 when Hubel and Wiesel characterized the <i>simple and complex cells</i> of V1, and finally to 2012 when Geoff Hinton and others used <i>hierarchical models</i> based on ideas from visual cortex to revolutionize computer vision.</p>

	<h2>1953: Retinal ganglion cells</h2>
	<p>To start off we're going to put you in the shoes of Stephen Kuffler. You've placed an electrode in the retina of an anesthetized cat and you're now showing pinpricks of light. You can literally do this below, the large round display below is the "retina" of the animal, and if you move your mouse you should see the "pinprick" of light appear. Remember, you're recording from <b>one neuron</b>, and that neuron has a receptive field somewhere in the retina: a region of the retina that it responds to. You'll see and hear the responses on the red line above the retina. The line shows the voltage measured by the electrode, by now you've probably already seen or heard it "pop" with a random action potential. When you find the receptive field you should hear it go wild. Your task is to find and <b>map</b> the receptive field: it has areas that are <b>excitatory</b> or activated by light and areas that are <b>inhibitory</b>.</p>
	<p><b>Tools:</b> to help you map the retina you can do two things. First, you can change the size and intensity of your pinprick by using the slider bars. Second, if you click on the retina you can <b>mark</b> a region. You'll first see a green area appear. This green area indicates you believe that this position is <b>excitatory</b> for the neuron. Click again and it becomes red, indicating that you think it is <b>inhibitory</b>. Click a third time and it returns to neutral. Explore the visual space to find the excitatory and inhibitory areas and then mark them as such, when you're successful the tutorial will display the true receptive field for you and allow you to continue</p>
