	<h2>Simple cells, complex cells, and deep neural networks</h2>

	<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

	<p>In this lab we will be exploring some of the details of the simple and complex cells which we learned about in lecture. You will be running some example code which will show you how different cells “see” the world and eventually using a deep neural network similar to those that Facebook, Google, Tesla, and Apple are using to identify you in your images, control their driverless cars, and understand your voice when you ask your phone for information.</p>

	<h1 id="learninggoals">Learning goals</h1>

	<p>After this lab you should have a better understanding of the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>How cells in visual cortex can act as filters, only detecting certain patterns of information.</li>
	<li>How representations in the cortical visual hierarchy become more complex as you proceed deeper through cortical areas.</li>
	<li>Be able to explain why invariance is an important property to have in the highest levels of visual cortex.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1 id="sectionlabs">Lab sections in Psych 50</h1>

	<p>This is our first section in Psych 50 so we want to take a brief moment to orient you to how these lab tutorials work. Your TA probably aleady mentioned that we will have a mixture of open discussions, demonstrations, and tutorials. The tutorials are an introduction to <b>computation models</b> as a tool for understanding the brain, and we use programming to run our models. You'll get the most out of these labs if you work together with a partner and discuss what's happening at each step. Your TA is available to answer questions that you can't solve on your own. In today's lab you'll just be going through examples that we've made for you, but in future labs you will have to write some parts of the computational models yourself. We don't expect you to learn to program during this class but we do expect you to (1) learn the computational models presented in lab, and (2) understand the value of modeling as a tool to understand the brain.</p>

	<p>If you already know how to program you will find bonus content sprinkled throughout the tutorials. This content is not required but will help you get a more in-depth understanding of what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
</div>

<div id="block2">
	<h2>What are computational models</h2>
	<p>Think about the following description: When I throw something into the air, gravity causes it to fall back down. This is a verbal model of the <i>behavior</i> of something that we have observed. It isn't the only possible verbal model, we could add all kinds of complexity, but it has a certain simplicity to it that is enticing.</p>
	<img width=400 src="images/verbalmodel.png"/>
	<p>All of our knowledge comes in this form. We take observations of the world and we distill them into models. It turns out that in general a model has the following structure: given some input, compute something, create an output. The input to our verbal model might be how hard we threw the ball and the output will be where the ball ends up. So you can immediately see that if I say to you: "This time, throw the ball less hard", or "Throw the ball a lot less hard", that these change the input to our model, and therefore the output.</p>
	<img width=400 src="images/verbalmodel2.png"/>
	<p>Now a <b>computational</b> model is simply a verbal model rephrased in terms of specific numbers. For example our model from above can be rephrased as:</p>
	<div id="katex1"></div>
	<p>The <b>f</b> is a placeholder for the computation we're doing in deciding where the ball will end up. We'll come back to these more formal ideas later in the class. For now we want you to simply keep this core idea in mind: a <b>computational model</b> is a simplified explanation of some behavior we observed, formalized to take an input and <b>compute</b> an output. Let's go on and use this idea to think about the visual cortex.</p>		
</div>

<div id="block3">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>A neuron in the visual cortex is like a small computer (or computational unit). Each neuron gets inputs from other neurons and if you go back far enough you eventually get to the retina, where the original inputs are photons of light. For any given neuron in visual cortex you can stick an electrode in and listen to that neuron's activation. This is making an <b>observation</b> about a neuron. Now, you can show different visuals to a neuron and by keeping track of what activates or inactivates the neuron you can get a sense of what that neuron cares about. With enough observations you can then start thinking about your model to answer the question: what is this particular neuron doing? Understanding this question will be our goal today.</p>
	<p>Our first foray into neurons is going to happen right at the retina. In the retina there are retinal ganglion cells which receive more or less direct inputs from the photoreceptors. That is: the neuron's input is the presence or absence of photons in the immediate surrounding region. As you'll soon see retinal ganglion cells perform a simple computation. The responses of these cells to light were first studied by Stephen Kuffler in 1953. Kuffler did two things: (1) He explored what area of the retina each retinal ganglion cell responded to, which we call the <b>receptive field</b>, and (2) he explored what kinds of stimuli the retinal ganglion cells are responsive to, which we call sensitivity to a <b>feature</b>.</p>
	<p>Now we're going to go back in time to 1953 and recreate Kuffler's classic experiment in your browser.</p> 
</div>

<div id="block4">
	<h2>Tools to study neurons</h2>
	<p>Before actually studying the retina we want to quickly orient you to the toolkit we're going to give you. You'll see a panel like the one below. Your job will be to adjust the stimulus and move it around to find the areas of the retinal field that activate or inhibit this particular neuron. When you find these, you can mark them (by clicking). A green cross indicates that you believe a region activates the neuron, a red minus indicates you believe it inhibits the neuron. When you have done a good enough job mapping the receptive (mapping both activated and inhibited regions), the tutorial will allow you to continue.</p>

</div>

<div id="block5">
	<h2>1953: Retinal ganglion cells</h2>
	<p>You've placed an electrode in the retina of an anesthetized cat and you're now showing pinpricks of light. Remember: your goal is to find and <b>map</b> the receptive field: it has areas that are <b>excitatory</b> or activated by light and areas that are <b>inhibitory</b>. When you're successful the tutorial will display the true receptive field for you and allow you to continue</p>
	<div style="text-align:center;">
		<div class="4u" style="text-align:center">
			<input type="range" min="1" max="5" value="2" step="1" oninput="changeSize(this.value);"/>
		</div>
		<div class="4u">
			<output id="size1">radius=10</output>
		</div>
		<canvas width=200 height=100 id="output1"></canvas>	
	</div>
	<canvas style="cursor:none" width=400 height=400 id="visual1"></canvas>
 	<div id="endblock3"><p>Congratulations! You've mapped your first receptive field. You can now see the areas that were excitatory and inhibitory. We call this particular kind of neuron a center-surround neuron, because it has a center that is excited by light, but a surrounding region that is inhibited by light.</p>
 	<p>Before going on we want you to do two things: First, try using a very large radius stimulus (20px+), what do you notice happens to the response of the neuron if you overlap both the excitatory and inhibitory regions? Why is this happening? Second, what do you expect the purpose of a neuron like this to be? By this we mean: what <b>feature</b> do you think this kind of a neuron detects? You should know that there are both center-surround neurons that have an excitatory center and inhibitory surround and the reverse. What aspect of an image does this make you think of?</p></div>
</div>

<div id="block6">
	<h2>Center-surround cells detect edges</h2>
	<p>The answer to the question we posed on the previous page is that center-surround cells detect edges. In the image below we're showing you a raw image and a version that has been "filtered" by a center-surround type cell. The filtering process involved re-calculating each pixel in the image based on the response of a center-surround cell with a receptive field centered at that pixel. This results in the new image that you see.</p>
	<img src=""/>
	<p>As you can see the edges have been highlighted, as promised! This is what we mean when we say that neurons in visual cortex prefer certain kinds of features. You can also now describe a verbal model for center-surround cells: what is the input? what is the computation performed? what is the output?</p>
</div>

<div id="block7"> 
	<h2>1963: Simple cells</h2>
	<p>About five years after Kuffler mapped cells in the retina two researchers at Johns Hopkins, Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel began setting up their own cat lab, now attempting to record from cells in the early visual cortex. The story of how they discovered what kinds of features activate V1 cells is <a href="https://youtu.be/IOHayh06LJ4?t=13">here on YouTube</a> and is quite surprising: it was a complete accident. If you want to skip the video the answer turns out to be <b>oriented bars</b>. But the real question is: what kind of a receptive field do you need to detect oriented bars? For figuring out the answer (among many other contributions) Hubel and Wiesel received the 1981 Nobel Prize. Now you get the opportunity to repeat their classic experiment below:</p>
	<div style="text-align:center;">
		<div class="4u" style="text-align:center">
			<input type="range" min="1" max="5" value="2" step="1" oninput="changeSize(this.value);"/>
		</div>
		<div class="4u">
			<output id="size7">length=10</output>
		</div>
		<canvas width=200 height=100 id="output7"></canvas>	
	</div>
	<canvas style="cursor:none" width=400 height=400 id="visual7"></canvas>
 	<div id="endblock7"><p>Nice work! We've now revealed to you the true receptive field. You can keep trying different stimuli now to help you understand why this particular setup is responsible for generating the pattern of responses you observed. While you do this think about the next question in our tutorial: we know that V1 simple cells get inputs from retinal ganglion cells, can you imagine how you might sum up the output of multiple retinal ganglion cells to get a receptive field like the one above?</p></div>
</div>

<div id="block8"> 
	<h2>Simple cells from retinal ganglion cells</h2>
	<p>The graphic below walks you through how to build a V1 simple cell using the output of center-surround cells. It turns out to be quite simple--it's just a matter of combining a few cells in a line.</p>
	<img src=""/>
	<p>What's particularly interesting about this is that we've gone one synapse (neuron-to-neuron connection) further and simultaneously gone one stage up in complexity. In fact instead of just responding to points (one dimension), we can now respond to lines (two dimensions). As you might expect when we go further into the visual cortex hierarchy things will continue to become more complex. If you're curious there is a bonus content section below which explains the computational model we use to build simple cell receptive fields. This bonus content is not required! But if you have time do check it out, it's quite interesting.</p>

		<h2>Bonus content: Simple cell model</h2>
		<p>When we built up the receptive field on this page we didn't actually connect retinal ganglion cells together to generate a simple cell (although we could have done this). It's simpler in practice to make a model of the simple cells directly, and this was also something that Hubel and Wiesel outlined in their early papers. </p>
