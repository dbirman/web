&ensp; SCSH-E and the Gizzards of Goz
<br><br>
Beep... beeep... beeeeep... beeeeeeeep.... beep beep beep beep beep. Disoriented, the pilot wakes up from a deep sleep and opens her eyes. In front of her on the console a series of lights, of every color and type, are flashing endlessly. As her thoughts re-organize themselves the sounds slowly crystallize into meaning: "EMERGENCY LANDING--EMERGENCY LANDING". Understanding suddenly turns into action and she flips a number of switches, dismayed at the lack of response from the ship she settles back into her chair. Modern scout ships like this one were designed to be pointed in one direction and then put on autopilot, in cases of emergency, such as now, her training told her that a manual override existed. Unfortunately, it had failed to engage when she activated the appropriate sequence on the console. In any case, there was little to be done. The ship was heading down onto a planet which the console noted was marked as "E-3". The scout, third class scout E, was en route to this planet but appropriate atmospheric measurements would normally have been in order prior to landing. She would have to learn about the atmosphere on the ground, as her ship was now decelerating through the thin upper atmosphere of E-3 and the blaze of heat had obliterated any measurements that her sensors would be trying to make. In a few minutes she would be on the ground.
<br><br>
As it turned out, a part had broken off the rear engine, but third class scout E didn't know this at the time and wouldn't find out until later. At this moment, at an altitude of nine kilometers above the surface, she was only thinking about how the engines had suddenly gone quiet and the electrical power which normally lit up the console had suddenly gone out. The ship, built more or less like a rock with two small volcanos on the sides was now taking on a trajectory much more appropriate for its size and weight--straight down. Previously, the two engines had, by accelerating and then ejecting the end results of a nuclear reaction, pushed the ship on a tangential trajectory. Ultimately this change in trajectory made little difference, the ship's horizontal velocity was stopped not by the gradual pull of gravity and slow deceleration of the air, but by a massive dune of sand in the middle of a desert. 
<br><br>


squishy is in her spaceship but the engine is beeping, she goes in the back and finds that a bolt is missing and then the ship goes into emergency landing mode--headed for an uncharted planet in a nearby solar system. The planet is marked as E-3. Squishy announces on the radio 'this is scout E--mayday! mayday!' and then the power dies
ship crash lands into the desert, squishy gets out, takes the screw thta's missing the bolt with her, puts on her goggles, ties her hair back in a pony tail, rolls up her sleeves, and heads out! after walking for a long time she sees in the distance figures on one of the sand dunes. She waves and approaches but they vanish into the distance. She also sees smoke coming from the direction they left in, an dgoes that way.
eventually after walking a long time she sees what looks like a big pile of rocks in the distance, she gets closer and finds an empty town, surrounded by the remains of a forest that have been burned.
she explores one of the houses which seems to be made of mud and finds hundreds of little eyes in the house
all the people run around screaming, they crash into each other and eventually calm down
they explain that they are the scannons and that they rarely get visitors way out in the desert like this
one of the scannons, lou, comes up (all the scannons say 'lou lou lou lou')

squishy explains that she's looking for a bolt to put on her screw, she gives the scannons the screw and they all go oohh ahhh oooh ahh. lou announces that he thinks she needs to find the gizzards of goz! and he's quite sure that they can help her, even though he doesn't really know what they are. lou explains that this desert is on the far west side of world, and that if she heads east eventually she'll get to the great river, which splits the dessert from everything else. If she follows the river to the ocean she'll find people who can point her in the direction of the gizzards.

Squishy decides to spend the night, and all the scannons gather around a huge fire in the center of town. Lou begins telling the story of the scannons and how they find themselves in the dessert.

**************************
** Lou and the Scannons **
**************************

A long long time ago this dessert was actually a jungle, and in this jungle lived the giants! The giants were huge monstrous beasts that could eat an entire tree all at once. They could lick the ice cream off of the moon with their enormous necks! And they could flick away pesty carnivores with their fascinating tails. But what really set them apart was their poop! Once a day, always in th eevening befor ethey went to sleep the giants would drop the leftovers from their tree meals. These were giant spherical poops. Most of the poops were just leftover tree trunk materials, so if they were hollowed out they made excellent homes and d 	efenses from all of the terrible beasts in the jungle. Scannons of course, being small and vulnerable, were among the lowest items in the food chain. During the day they would ride on the backs of the giants, picking fruits off of the trees that the giants wandered past. At night they would hollow out the poops and hide inside, away from the cold jungle nights and any beasts. This cycle had gone on for millenia until the fires came. The fires came from the south, which is where the river flows from. Scannons had never gone far to the south, because the giants never wandered in that direction. They don't know what happened but every year there were more and more fires, which pushed the jungle farther and farther north. Occasionally a giant would wander all the way down near the edge of the jungle, and they would see the devastation caused by the fires. Huge swaths of the forest were destroyed and burned. It used to be that when a fire started in the jungle the heavy rains that often fell would put it out, but these fires burned so hot that the rain simply turned to steam and floated away. The scannons of course had no power over the fires, being as small as they are, so eventually over the years the entire jungle was eaten up by the fire--leaving behind only empty desert. The scannons followed the giants, but over time there were fewer and fewer giants. Over the years they ran out of food as the forest got thinner and thinner, until finally there was just one pair of giants left. The last few hundred scannons had gathered together on their backs--until one final fire was raised up. The giants wandered into the desert and left behind one last pile of poop. When the scannons woke up the next morning and looked out into the smoke from the fire the giants were gone, and there was only desert all around. They've been in the same place since then! Squishy asks about how they get food and water, trapped in the dessert. The scannons take her into one of their poop houses and shows her that mushrooms grow all over the inside (beautiful mushroom sthat glow in the dark) and that water gets trapped in the walls, so they have everything they need. All of the scannons except lou meanwhile have fallen asleep around the fire, so Squishy curls up and falls asleep a well.

*****************
** A Rainy Day **
*****************

In the morning squishy gets up while the scannons are still asleep, packs her stuff together, and heads farther east towards the river. Pretty quickly the desert turns into small shrubs and grasses, and quickly becomes a grassland. Once the grasses get to knee height or so she gets to the river. It's a huge flow, maybe a hundred feet across, and coming slowly down the river are small icebergs and little flotillas of ice. She can see downstream that there is a stone bridge that was built, perhaps a few miles away. Squishy sets off in the direction of the bridge, while a light rain starts to fall. As she keeps going south there start to be small dense trees in thickets on each side of the river, and there's clearly a forest in the distance on the far side. 
After an hour or so of walking she hears some howling in the distance, not unlike the howling of an injured wolf perhaps, or some other animal. Looking out in the distance she sees an iceberg, larger than the rest, with some kind of animal stuck to it. She spies a shallow area just a bit downstream where there are some larger rocks that aren't submerged, which she thinks she could use to reach the animal. The animal is making all the noise. Squishy pulls down a larger tree branch and, using it as a balance, she steps out onto the first of the rocks, and carefully makes her way farther out into the river. About twenty feet out she comes close enough to be able to jump onto the iceberg as it floats past--using her sticks like tools, plunging them into the ice to keep from slipping. All the while the animal on the iceberg is howling its distress and unhappiness. Squishy works her way up the iceberg, picking with her tree branch tools, until she comes up to the animal itself and sees that its a seal, held down by a single large metal picket,  stabbed through its tail. The seal has its eyes closed and is still howling--but its more of a melancholy howl than one of pain. She apologies to the seal, who doesnt notice her at all, and pulls the picket out in one quick movemen.

************
** Rainy  **
************

Scsh-e works her way back down from the iceberg, keeping an eye out for a good place to drop off into the river. She also keeps an eye out for the seal--but it doesn't come back. After a half hour of sitting there still isn't any sign of a good place, so she works her way down to jump in the water and swim back to shore. Right as she gets down to water level the seal pokes its head out of the water and asks "do you want a ride?". "Yes, I would" scsh-e responds, and gets down onto the seals back. It's slippery, but she only has to have her feet in the water, and with her boots on she barely feels the cold at all. At first they move in silence, and all they hear is the pitter patter of rain falling on the surface of the water, but eventually the seal says "Thanks... for saving me back there, I was miserable". "You're welcome, my name is Scsh-e." responds squishy. "What's yours?". "Oh! I don't know" says the seal. "I've never had a name before!" his eyes grew larger. "What's my name? I don't know! Ooh this is exciting!". Right then they get to shore, and the seal pulls itself up onto the bank on the far side of the river, near the forest. Scsh-e jumps down and looks at the seal and says, "I think I'll call you rainy, since I found you on a rainy day. What were you doing stuck on that iceberg?". Rainy looks at her and smiles, saying "Oh! Rainy! I like it. I'm a battle seal from the north--but I've been thrown out of my regiment". Scsh-e takes off her backpack and rummages through to find a meal pack, she takes one out with some chocolate and offers it to rainy the seal who gladly takes it. She also takes out a bandage and starts to cover rainy's wound. "Tell me about what it's like to be a battle seal" Scsh-e asks rainy as she bandages his wound. "Oh! Well--I wasn't always a battle seal. Once I was just a regular seal, but then the Swails came. They changed everything and they put all the animals in the arctic to work. I worked first in the mines which was terribly tiring. But eventually a war broke out between the swails and told the seals that we had to go fight our brothers and sisters who were under the command of another swail... I refused!". Rainy went silent for a moment. "So, what happened?" Scsh-e asked him. "Oh! Well, they banished me... I can't ever go back. They'll kill me if I go back. If you hadn't saved me from that iceberg eventually I would have gone all the way to the south ocean, and us seals can't swim there--the water's different and we sink. So thanks". Rainy and Scsh-e sat in silence together, eventually Scsh-e offers to build a fire so they can spend the night here. Rainy says that's a great idea, but to be careful, he's heard that in the woods here there are claws. They used to live in the west in the jungle until it burned down, but now they've moved to other places. Scsh-e goes to the edge of the woods to find more of the bamboo-like wood, but instead she sees that here the trees are larger and older, with intertwined limbs connecting the trees together and creating hollow paths into a dark forest below. In the distance the sun is setting over the desert--and she sees what might look like another mirage, black figures silhouetted against the sun up on the dunes.

***************
** The Scout **
***************

In the morning Squishy wakes up and sees Rainy coming back up out of the water, with fish he caught in his mouth. They light a fire with the remaining wood and roast the fish while they chat. Rainy asks Squishy, "So what are you doing out here?". So Squishy begins her story:
Well--before  I crash landed in the desert last week I was a scout for an exploratory expedition. I'm from another solar system where the sun is dying and we're trying to find a world that we can move to. There were two expeditions sent out and mine was the first. When we left, the technology they were using the jump across space was pretty imperfect--and they told us that we would all arrive at different times. When I arrived, just the other day, and my ship woke me up there were all sorts of mechanical problems going on--and there's a key part of the ship that went missing." Here Squishy takes out the bolt and shows it to Rainy. "You see, I have to find metal on this planet that I can use to fix this missing piece. There was metal in that piton that had you stuck to the iceberg, but it felt into the river before I had time to take a careful look. So if there's metal in the arctic we'll have to go there eventually." Oh no! Rainy responded-- "we can't go there now... I can't go there!". "Well, first we'll go to these gizzards of goz that the scannons told me about, and if that doesn't work we can come back." "So what was your home like?" asked Rainy. "I don't know." Squishy responded. "What do you mean?". "I never knew my solar system--I was born in space to be a scout and raised for my mission. I've never known anything beyond my ship and the station I was trained on. And everything there was automated--I only met one other person from my world, another scout--before we both were sent out. I wonder what happened to her." By now the fish were steaming on the inside and getting crisp on the outside, so they each took one, and ate the cooked flesh off the bones. They spend some time in silence working through their meal, before Rainy proposes that they move on. "Should we start walking? I think we should get into the woods while there's plenty of light--it looked dark in there." "Sure, when my ship came down I thought that mountain seemed like a promising landmark, why don't we head there first?" Squishy responded. So they head off, entering the dark woods through a tunnel in the underbrush, disappearing into the darkness.

**************************
** The Lizards of Pause **
**************************
After walking for a few hours farther and farther into the forest Rainy begins to get the sense that they might be lost. It's been a few hours now since the last time they were able to see out through the tree tops to make sure they were still heading for the mountain, and a number of times they were turned around by ravines and streams criss-crossing the old forest. The trees are no longer the sparse bamboo woods that lined the river but are now thick gnarled old woods with branches that intertwine between trees criss crossing into a vast mesh of leaves above them. The woods are damp because of how little light reaches down to the forest floor, and little critters scurry around them in the trees and through the brush on the sides of the paths they wander through. Eventually Rainy gets concerned and speaks up, "Squishy--I... I think we might be all turned around here. I'm used to being out in the open ocean or up on a glacier and seeing all around me, this forest gives me the creeps. I think we're lost!". As he finished his sentence, looking around into the woods a bit nervously, Squishy turned around to him with her hood down over her eyes, her finger to her lip. "Something's watching us. It's been following us for a few minutes. Don't move". In a flash Rainy watches as Squishy darts up onto a tree branch close to the ground, he watches as she pulls two long silver darts out of her bag and slips them onto a mechanism hidden on her wrist. In silence the two of them wait.
"All right!" says a voice out of the darkness in the brush. "Put the weapons ....... down and we'll come out! We don't ........ mean to hurt you or your friend!". Rainy looks at Squishy, whose face is still hidden under her hood. For a moment she pauses before brushing the hood back and smiling. She raises her arms and the darts drop back into her bag.
Out from the brush come slithering a number of bright orange lizards--their color clashing with the dark green of the foliage around them. Rainy wonders how they avoided being seen for so long, but his thoughts are interrupted when one of them speaks suddenly:
"We're sorry we ...... scared you! Can't be too sure these days  ..... with the claws roaming around--had ...... to be certain you weren't out to hunt ..... us! What are you doing around these woods?"
"We're looking for the gizzards of goz, they're supposed to help us find something I need" Squishy starts preparing to tell her story--but before she can finish the lizards grin and laugh hysterically."The Gizzards of Goz! Oh that's ...... wonderful! Haha!". A lizard wipes a tear from his eye before turning to Rainy and announcing, "Gizzards of Goz!!!"
The whole group breaks out into racuous laughter. Eventually, when they calm down, Squishy shows them the bolt she's missing and Rainy asks them about whether they know about the Swails. The lizards explain to the pair that up on the mountain there is an old hermit. In the past, before the claws came, they say that he used to forge metal like the bolt Squishy needs out of the lava that flows on the mountain. Squishy and Rainy ask them for help getting to the mountain--but the lizards are too afraid to go there. They explain that the claws live on the mountain now and that it isn't safe for the lizard anymore, they can't hide on the mountain because their color stands out so starkly. The lizards walk with the two travelers and take them close to the base of the mountain, only an hours journey from where they were lost before. As they approach the ground starts to slope upwards and the forest floor begins to lend way to rocky outcrops and boulders. Eventually the forest begins to thin and a new kind of tree takes over--thin bendable trees with thin little needles for leaves, which don't sway even in the wind.
"I'm sorry we can't ...... go any farther with you" one of the lizards says. "But we can give ...... you some advice---the claws only come out in the daylight, they ...... won't travel in the darkness ..... and they certainly won't go into dark ...... places like caves. The old hermit will be in ...... a cave up there, on the north side where there ..... isn't so much sunlight".
"Thanks for your help" Squishy says to the lizards. "Sure--good luck up there. Beware of ........ the claws! We hope you find .... those gizzards!" the lizzards collapse into racuous laughter at this last word, and Squishy and Rainy set off again with smiles on their faces.

*************************
** Blizzards and Claws **
*************************

As Rainy and Squishy emerge from the forest the sun is setting in the west over the desert. Through the thinning trees they can see the colors of the sky as it gets purple, then red. Meanwhile from the east there is a strong cold wind blowing over the mountain and the clouds are getting gray and increasingly dark as the sun fades away. The pair climb higher and higher in the darkness. As they go higher the talus slope changes the size of the rocks gets smaller and smaller and the rock becomes a dark porous rock. Finally, the temperature suddenly drops and snow begins to fall. They continue onwards, following the slope of the hillside upward blindly in the storm. As they stumble on the snow falls harder and harder and they lose track of time in the dark. Huddled inside of her cloak, her hood far down over her face, Squishy is reminded of the bubble of her ship and the silence of being in space. She trudges onward, feeling the cold on her face, but warm inside of her exploration suit. She pulls her hood farther down and steps on, following the track that Rainy is clearing away in front of her. Rainy in front feels at home, pushing through the snow much more easily than the rocks that he stumbled over or the roots in the forest. The cold wind reminds him of the open plain of ice that remains as his last memory of the north. The two walk ever upwards in the quiet padding of snowfall.

Suddenly--Rainy snaps to, and realises he has been daydreaming, and that he can see out much farther than before. The white gleam of snow extends up the mountain into a white fog that surrounds them in every direction. "Scsh-e--I think the sun is coming up". Scsh-e looks up and flips her hood down--her tired eyes scan the horizon. "Yeah, if the lizards were right then we need to be hidden soon. " scsh-e responds. "Let's start looking for a cave, the lizards said there were many lava tubes coming up out of the volcano and that their warmth would keep them free of snow". Together the continue walking up as the light gets brighter and brighter on the snow, shining back up on them. Rainy looks out and turns to Scsh-e: "Hurry. Up ahead theres a patch of rock with no snow on it--look!". Stumbling over hidden rocks and through piles of snow they begin moving at a steady jog. Scsh-e looks back and sees dark figures moving through the fog, small lithe figures close to the ground, a steady clicking noise following them up the mountain. "Run Rainy!" she yells. As they approach the black of patch of rocks the snow melts disappears, melting from the heat of the lava far inside of the volcano. They don't look back--as the clicking noises steadily approach. "HERE! In HERE!" a deep booming voice sounds from the very center of the rocks. Scsh-e and Rainy scramble through the dark rock piles, slipping on small pebble-like chunks of ash, and then slide down into a dark cave. Outside of the cave the clicking is replaced by scratching noises at the edge of the light. "Did you hear that voice Rainy, what was that?" Scsh-e asks, looking into the darkness, her eyes still unadjusted. "That was Me!" says a booming low voice, "But don't worry I'm just Blub the Once-Was, and you'll be safe here."
 
***********************
** Blub the Once-was **
***********************

"Who said that?" asked Rainy "Can you come forward more? We can't see you!". "Sure, hold on" said the cacophonous voice. And slowly but surely a huge figure emerged from out of the darkness. Blub turned out to be a loud voice but only a small creature, at first glance made mostly of fat overflowing from all of his body parts. Despite this he seemed to move deftly forward over the rocks in the cave, coming to rest with a sigh by the entrance with Rainy and Squishy. "What are you doing back here?" asked Scsh-e, looking confused at the strange thing that had appeared before her. "Ahhh! A story! I will tell you a story about myself. Let me tell you about my homeland!" and so Rainy and Scsh-e made themselves comfortable among the broken volcanic rocks, listening to the buffering noises of the storm outside and the occasional boom of thunder far in the distance. 

You wouldn't believe it now but I was once a great king! Yes! King over a mighty and great city in the jungle. My people lived in a village in the jungle and we survived off the fruits and goods we found in the treetops. You might be surprised by I'm quite happy in the dark in this cave, because we are all adapted to living at night. We had to avoid the claws and the other creatures that roam the jungle during the day you see. Oh it was a wonderful life for a long long time, but when the fires came my village was one of the first to be destroyed. We were close to the north where the snows are permanent and one night we saw a great flaming meteor fall from the sky. From that day on the fires burned throughout the jungle, encroaching on our home every single day. Eventually I had no choice! I told my subjects to prepare their things and that we would have to cross the river to lands untouched by the fire. The great river that once divided the two halves of the jungle was wide enough not to be crossed by the fire, and so we headed there first. The forest near the river was one of the last places that fell to the fires and eventually we were forced across to the forest on the far side. It was there that the claws began to terrorize us. You see we were used to living high up in the treetops and sleeping in hammocks, but the trees here were low to the ground and it was just too difficult to stay safe during the daytime. We chose to run eventually and find shelter up here on the mountain where we found many caves in the volcanic rock. But it wasn't enough, we had to head down into the forest every night to find food--scarce already because the trees here that provide fruit are few and far between. Eventually all my subjects vanished! I've been alone now several days, going crazy in this cave and wondering what would happen next. But now you're here and you will help me. You can go back out and find my subjects--there must be a few more out there wondering which cave I'm in! Any day now they will find me and bring me more provisions.

Throughout the story Rainy and Squishy listened patiently, but by the end Rainy butted in to say "I don't know Blub--whatever those claws that chased us are they aren't friendly. And there are certainly a lot of them.". Scsh-e turned to Blub to say "I think you should come with us, we're going to find the Gizzards of Goz--they have something that I need". "Gizzards of Goz huh?" Blub said with a strange face, "I see... yes I could come with you. I've heard of creatures that live at the top of this mountain, forging strange objects in the lava there. Yes I'll come with you!" Blub stood up forcefully all at once, surpsiringly quickly for his massive girth. "Look! The sun is setting, lets get moving while we have plenty of time. Follow me--I can see clearly even in this darkness." the group, now three, stumbled slowly back up and out of the cave to a surprising sight. For the first time since her landing on the planet Scsh-e watched as a huge moon rose above the horizon.

*************************
** 9: Fissures **
*************************

Before leaving Blub had gathered together his last belongings into a large bag and now he was shouldering this bag as they wandered up through the rocks. In the moonlight Squishy and Rainy could see that Blub is in fact quite muscular despite his girth and he bobbed and jumped over the rocks with ease. Squishy speculated to herself that perhaps his clothing was like hers, more advanced than they looked, and were giving him an extra muscular boost. Rainy meanwhile was just happy to out in the snow again, and was enjoying himself immensely as he easily skimmed over the rocks wherever the snow had stuck to the warm ground. It took the group a long hour to get up onto the plateau formed by the top of the volcano. The closer they got the more they could smell the sulfur and feel the change in temperature. The volcano, active as ever, was slowly oozing lava out of many cracks and crevices. The higher they go on the mountain the more they run into small pools and openings where there are flashes of light far below. Eventually Blub stops them, holding his arms out to his side.

"Look! Claws!"

Rainy and Squishy look up into the distance, squiting in the moonlight, and see four tall figures standing on the snow. "I don't think so..." says Squishy quickly, "I've seen those things before, in the desert, they're too tall--not at all like the claws we saw last night". "And anyways" Rainy adds "the claws never showed themselves to us, why would they now. these might be the people we came looking for". But as quickly as they saw them, the slender men disappear into the rocks farther up the mountain. The three continue climbing, following a fissure in the rock that grows wider and wider into a canyon. Deep down in the fissure they can see lava, and as they get close they see another of the slender beings far down in the hole, working with the lava. They watch from a distance as the slender man pulls a bucket of lava out, pours it into a mold, and then dumps icy water onto the mold. He throws the cast metal onto a pile off to the side, and begins repeating the process after a few minutes.

"SCSH-e isn't that what you're looking for?" Blub asks, but when he turns to the side only Rainy is there. Rainy looks back at him, smiles showing his sharp teeth, and shrugs his huge shoulders. "She just walked away a few minutes"--when he suddenly gets caught off by Blub saying "Look!". Down in the fissure, far below them, they see Scsh-e approaching the slender man.

...

Before going down into the fissure Squishy took the time to adjust her gear. She takes her gloves out of her pack and slips them on. The gloves form a part of her standard issue suit. All exploratory scouts were issued a class-3 exploration suit, suitable both for deep space and local exploration of planetary surfaces. When SCSH-e first got her suit--by delivery in an unmanned space probe--she remembers reading the manual from front to back, learning about its ability to enable electromagnetic camouflage, both for visible light and infrared heat signatures, as well as its myriad features for survival, such as water recycling and solar food production. But most importantly she had been impressed with the suit's extendable hood and cloak, designed for weather, as a blanket, and to deflect weapons, she had felt invincible the first time she pull it around her in the space station's practice room, years before. She began to spend all of her time in the suit, quickly learning to modify the parts that were bulky or loose. And finally the station's monitoring system had instructed her to test the suit outside. "Outside?" she had thought--the idea of going out of the space station had never cross her mind before then. It was her only home and although she knew her job was to be a scout, and she had daydreamed often about the planets she would one day visit, it hadn't occurred to her that she would need to go into space. Her station, EOS-5, had no stars or planets nearby, and was placed entirely outside of any solar systems. She was always surrounded by stars, visible in the distance as pinpoints of light in every direction, but her natural instincts had told her that the darkness right outside the ship was to be feared. But the station was firm in its instructions--obtain an exploration mask and gloves, seal them onto the suit, and enter the airlock. She had put the mask on. It was a large gray circle, with four slits--a filter to allow air in when possible, or to recycle air from the internal scrubs. From the inside you could see out through the entire mask, but from the outside it was simply a black hole--the mask being covered by a material that absorbed all incoming light. It was supported by the suits hood, which itself had a rigid skeleton which could be frozen in any particular position. In the air lock of the station squishy had paused after putting the mask on, listening to the magnetic seals closing around her and the suits air systems activating. She could feel air still leaking out at her hands, where she hadn't yet put her gloves on. She stopped for a long time, there were no sounds in the air lock except her own breathing. In the distance she could see the stars, slowly rotating around the station as it maintained internal gravity. Finally, she slipped the gloves on, feeling them seal into the suit. Her suit chimed, indicating complete isolation, and she pulled down on the air lock release. With alarms blaring around her she watched in awe as the bay doors opened slowly in front of her, revealing the vast emptiness that had always lay inches away from her.

Scsh-e snapped out of her daydream, slipping the gloves on. She pulled the face mask out of her bag and placed it over her face, her dark skin disappearing behind the light absorbing surface. She pulled her hood out and over, where it immediately snapped into place around the mask. She switched the suit to camouflage, and its color darkened suddenly to match the slightly purple hue of the rocks around her. Her suit chimed quietly to indicate that the protective seal was engaged, and she began quickly climbing down into the fissure. Ocassionally a light on the suits mask would flash indicating a heat source, or organic life identified on a rock, but otherwise all Scsh-e could hear was the sound of her own breathing going in and out of the mask. Within minutes she arrived at the bottom of the fissure, coming down close to the open fissure of lava. She carefully worked her way over the boulders, wary of the ocassional extreme temperature warnings flashing on her screen, to where the slender man was working. Her suit indicators showed that the sulfur gases here were too strong to remove her mask, and anyways the temperatures were well outside a comfortable range. So when the slender man next turned around from his work Squishy was standing out in the open, a safe distance away. "Are you one of the gizzards of goz?" she asks the creature. Up close she could see that it was a tall creature, not unlike Blub in its face and body, but skinny and tall, and wearing a dark colored, close fitting outfit. It looked at her, surprised, and then let out a low chortling laugh. Then it turned, away down the fissure from where she stood, and took off at a sprint. Scsh-e could see from a distance that the creature was following a path up and out of the fissure. Once it was a safe distance away she picked up some of the pieces of metal and examined them, comparing them to the bolt she had with her. The metal forged from the lava was crude, but it was also familiar, the piece that the creature was making resembled a part of her own ship's engine.

Blub, Rainy, and Squishy are gathered together down in one of the fissures in a dark cave, avoiding the daytime that has come on the mountain. Outside there is blue sky and a crisp wind that occasionally whistles past the cave entrance. Blub used a tool from his pack to collect a small pile of warm rocks from a nearby lava flow, which are now sitting between the trio in the darkness. Blub says to them, "I met these slender men before, actually. Although I didn't recognize them right away." ""What do you mean?". "Well they're different now, and anyways I met them at night one day in the jungle--I never got a good view of them". "I meant, how did you meet them?" Rainy interrupted. Skishy pulled out her cloak and brought her hood up to stay warm while she listened to Blub recount his experiences. Rainy rolled himself closer to the warm rocks, propping himself up on another rock. "Go on..." he asked. 

Well--it was many months ago, when the fires first came. In fact I think it was before any of the fires had appeared, just after the meteor came down from the sky. We had just had a feast in our little village, and as the sun set we were heading up into the trees, all of my servants had already gone up and they were preparing to hoist me into the canopy. That's when they made their first appearance--I was startled to see other people like us, although their clothing was remarkably different. Our clothing being made from the animals and plants that we found in the forest was simple, woven by hand, but theirs was clearly an advanced culture. They walked into the clearing where I stood waiting for my lift and told me, just like that, with no introduction, that "this forest is now ours, you must leave". "What!? Who are you?" I had asked them, incredelous--but they simply turned and walked away. It was just days later that the fires began.

"Wow--so you think it was these same beings that started the fires to drive you away?" Squishy speculated to Blub. "It seems obvious."

Yes. I thought that was probably the explanation. And now here they are building metal pieces, just like the ones you're looking for. You said you came from the sky as well Skishy--as a scout? Perhaps this is the rest of the scouts--although they don't look much like you, that's for sure. But let me continue... there was one day when a fire woke us in the middle of the night. It was burning just a few minutes away from where we slept, when we lowered down from the trees on our ropes we found a slender man there. He warned us that if we stayed any longer in the forest, we would all be killed one night. That night we were hunted by the claws. The fire was roaring behind us and as we ran to escape the claws came in from the sides ,through the thick underbrush. Servants were disappearing every few minutes until dawn. When the sun came up it began to rain as well--and soon the fire behind us went out. We searched the area for survivors that day and found a few scattered servants, separated by claws or by the fire in our dash for safety. But we also found one of the slender men--a claw had gotten to him as well, but perhaps it was too late in the night or maybe they aren't edible, but he left him there. His clothing I gave to a servant, but what we discovered underneath was more interesting. He wore a suit, which I'm wearing now, that lets them move without ever tiring. Out of habit I kept letting the servants carry me--but I don't really have any need for them anymore. Fortunately for you I suppose...

"Can I see the suit?" Squishy asked Blub

Why sure--why not? I don't like to sleep in it in any case." Blub took some time to get out of the suit, but eventually he handed it to Squishy--who saw immediately that it was a class-1 exploration suit. The same kind of clothing she herself wore. The others, uninterested in the technology itself, had dozed off in th e warm sunlight streaming down through the cave entrance, but Squishy was kept awake thinkig about what the suit meant. Clearly, the slender men were a part of an expedition force meant to follow her scout ship, but why were they already here? And if the slender men were from her world then why did one run away from her? Eventually, thoughts swirling through her head, Squishy pulled her hood down and relaxed--and went into a dreamless sleep.  

******************
** 11: The Fires (Part 2) **
******************

In the evening, as it begins to get dark outside the trio wake up from their naps and start getting ready to move. In the darkness now they can't see the walls of the cave as well, but they can see that outside the moon is rising against a purple orange sky. In the far distance they can see the tendrils of smoke that are rising up, probably out of the desert that's still burning. Blub, back in his suit and moving around rapidly to collect his gear, asks the others where they should go next. "So it seems like these Gizzards of Goz you're trying to find aren't here on this mountain after all, just claws and these slender men. Scsh-e, what will you do next?" he asks looking at her questioningly. Scsh-e responds after a moment, lost in her thoughts, "I don't know. I suppose we'll keep looking, the Lizards seemed to think there was something up here for us to find, maybe they mistook the slender men for what we're looking for." Rainy adds, slowly lumbering up onto his paws, "Well, I think we should get down off this mountain and away from the claws. They kept me up for hours, all I could hear was their footsteps ringing outside the cave.". By now the group was gathered at the cave entrance, peering out into the quickly brightening moonlight. Outside they can see down the mountain the way that they hiked up the day before, back down into the forest and beyond. On one side they can see the desert, a few small tendrils of smoking rising up into the darkness. But on the far side of the forest they can see light and much larger stacks of smoke--clearly active burning was still happening there. "I think, after hearing so much about these fires, that we should take a closer look." Scsh-e says, staring down at the lights below them. "I agree" Blub responds, "I've been wondering for many months now what could be happening. It seems high time that I actually found out.". "Fine with me--anything is fine if we get off the mountainside!" Rainy adds, following the other two as they start walking down the hill.
The night turns out to be crisp, with a chill wind blowing over the volcano. Ocassionally they get a whiff of sulfur from higher up on the mountain, or smell the acrid harsh smell of smoke from across in the forest. Their path takes them winding down first through larger boulders but eventually back out onto open scree slopes of small loose volcanic rocks. On the way down Scsh-e pulls out the metal piece she picked up from the forge that the slender man left behind. She can tell from the weight that it isn't quite the right kind of metal to replace the parts in the ship, only a crude replica, perhaps due to the limits of ores that the slender men could find on the mountain. She flipped the piece in her hands examining it more carefully, it was shaped somewhat like a donut, but with sharp edges due to the rock it was forged in. The parts in her ship were rounded and lighter. 
Meanwhile, Rainy, slower now because the snow had vanished as they lost altitude on the huge mountain, was thinking about his home in the north while Blub too was lost in thought, imagining the various unlucky fates that had come to his servants. All three of them were caught off guard when they realised they had arrived back down at the forest, as small trees and shrubs suddenly appeared around them. They continued on quietly as the trees grew larger around them, until eventually they were surrounded by the tall thick trunks of the gnarled old forest. Above them the sky was brightening and they can see, through the thick canopy, a huge cloud of smoke unfurling far above them. The smell of smoke getting stronger as they walk closer to the fires that are clearly burning out on the horizon. "Should we find a place to rest before we come out on the other side?" Scsh-e asks, turning to the others. "Sure, I can see a clearing up ahead" Blub answers. In the clearing, a small opening in the forest formed when one of the huge older trees fell over, pulling up its roots beside it. Once the trio are seated together in the center of the clearing Blub pulls some food out of his pack, offering a dense cake to each of them. "Try these--a specialty that my people made before we were pushed out of the forest, or desert now I guess". Rainy, taking a tentative bite, asks "What is it?", "A mixture of some of the fruits we used to eat there, cooked together they last for many many months. Good food to last through the colder parts of the year." "The colder parts?" Scsh-e asks, raising an eyebrow. "Oh yes, we have a short winter here, when the fruits stop appearing. We had to gather sufficient stores to make it through each year." Blub responded. Rainy, looking off to the north for a moment, adds "I miss the cold. Being up on that volcano in the snow reminded me of the north." Scsh-e, chewing on a bite of the dense cake, turns to Rainy to ask him, "You never finished telling me about your home and the Swails, will you tell us now? There's no reason to hurry to the fires, we might not find anything there anyways." Scsh-e nods, gathering his thoughts, before beginning. "I guess you could call this the story of the First Swail" he says. 

*************************
** 12: The First Swail **
*************************

When I was born the arctic was just a huge sea, with a few land masses and a sheet of ice covering anything. In the very far north there are mountains, but for most of the year because of the darkness we seals never went there. There are stories about seals who ventured into the far north and never came back, but honestly those all seemed ridiculous. Most seals are quite lazy, and the vast majority of us preferred to spend our time at the southern edges of the arctic where there was more consistent sun in the summers, and more consistent food! It was out here on the edge of the arctic circle that the ice, flowing down from the mountains at the pole, broke up into icebergs and floated out into the rivers, like the one you found me in, and down to the south. The ice we lived on was a mixture of ice covering land, and ice covering water--there were many small islands under the ice that would become uncovered during the summer, as well as tongues of land reaching down from farther in the north in the mountains. In the summer with the other seals we would lounge on the ice or down on the sandy beaches that would be uncovered as the ice melted, and ocasionally dive down into the rivers to take our chances picking up a fish. The fish, you see, migrate each year from down in the south to their spawning grounds in the north in the summertime. Millions and millions of fish come, many more than could ever be eaten by the number of seal, birds, and penguins that lived on those beaches. It was a happy and fairly simple life, ocasionally there were disputes between groups of seals along neighboring rivers, especially when the number of fish would dwindle in the fall or early in the spring when we were all starving and desperate to eat sometihng. But for the most part things were calm--there was of course the occasional visit by polar bears. When the polar bears would come we seals would turn to the training that we each receive as children about how to fight. Form into a wall--bare your teeth, and protect those around you. Every seal is willing to die for the sake of the group! And that was basically how it went for us for years, or at least as I grew up. But when the swails arrived things changed dramatically--

I'm not sure where the swails came from, but from one day to the next they were there. The swails had a skin made of a shiny material, like Blub's suit. At first they were just there, flying over us occasionally and sometimes lifting rocks or other objects and taking them away with them, but eventually they started interacting with the more elder seals. They had great booming voices, and when they talked to us they would land on the ground and become quieter, except for their voice. For many weeks there was a conversation between the elders and the swails, while the rest of us continued our lives with a certain apprehension, but eventually some kind of deal was made. The elder seals told us that there was some kind of war happening, and that we were going to be soldiers. Now--I come from a long line of battle seals, but we fight for ourselves not for other people. My elders fought in battles for fishing grounds and for territory to live on, they fought off polar bears and penguins, but I've never heard of a battle seal fighting for somebody else. It didn't feel that wrong until we actually went to a battle, the elders told us that we were to take back a small island near the north pole. It took us a day of travel through the streams and eventually over the glaciers to reach the site, a small volcanic perch that had pushed its way up out of an otherwise empty glacier. When we approached it we found penguins, hundreds of them, digging a huge hole into the ground. Nearby there were gigantic piles of rock and soil, excavated out from below. I don't know what they were doing but we massacred them--penguins, in their prime with armor and weapons are quite a force. A single penguin underwater is dangeorus, while a dozen make me scared on land--but here they didn't put up any fight. There was a single polar bear, perhaps a guard, but he loped off as soon as he saw us arriving. In the end--it was a massacre, we simply killed the exhausted penguins as they emerged. It wasn't right! That's not how it should happen.

Rainy took a moment to compose himself again, before continuing.

When the swails arrived after we had finished and cleaned up, they were carrying large compartments, like boxes, which opened and out came other penguins. Equally tired seeming they set to work doing the same work the penguins that had already been there were doing, loading the piles of rocks into the compartments. I voiced my displeasure to the elder seals and you know what happened next... 

"Will you go back?" Scsh-e asked Rainy

I want to... I have friends and family there and they must be suffering. But I know I won't be welcome.

"All these changes--it makes your head spin" Blub added, sleepily "Let's think on it tonight, and maybe when we go see who is starting these fires we will get answers to some of our questions."

*************************
** 13: Smoke **
*************************

In the morning Rainy woke up with a cough and opening his eyes realized that the whole forest was filled with a light layer of smoke. Clearly, the fires were still burning farther away from them he thought. The wind that had pushed the smoke over the volcano the night before was calm now and there was very little noise. Raising himself up he could see that Blub was still asleep and that Scsh-e was sitting on a log, looking out in the direction of the fires. Through the dim layers of smoke around them and the canopy above Rainy could just make out the huge pillars of smoke that lay ahead.

"Good morning Scsh-e"

Scsh-e looked over, clearing a cough from her throat she asked Rainy, "I've been thinking, Rainy, can you draw for me what one of the swails looks like?"

"I can try, these fins are no good for artwork though" Rainy answered, as he cleared away brush from the forest floor. With a huge sweep of his fin he made a large triangle, and put two circles below the ends. In the middle he drew a square box. "The windows, here, reflect the light--so in the daytime they look just like the sky".

"Mmh. Rainy, I think that the swails are tied to the slender men. What you drew there is a ship"

"A ship? No wonder it was so metallic... and that explains why there were no moving parts. It all felt wrong... So then there were slender men on the inside?"

"I don't know" Scsh-e answered, looking puzzled, "I have no idea what they could be doing. But they come from my world, and I need to know. Rainy I was supposed to be scouting this solar system by myself--it doesn't make sense that they're here."

Rainy smiled his big toothy smile at her, as he nudged Blub to wake him, "I think we'll get answers soon. If the slender men were in the north and on the volcano, then I think we know who started all these fires."

Right until they arrived at the edge of the forest the trio couldn't see the fires at all--and then, all of a sudden the canopy thinned out, the pillars of smoke became visible, and the roaring fire was in front of them. The thick forest was ablaze in a huge wall about a mile away--and between them and the fire was a huge plain of ashes and debris, some clearly burned away years ago while other parts were more recent. In places the ash had given way to tall stalks of new grass, growing quickly out of the fertile ground. About halfway across the field there was a dropoff, a large hole perhaps, which they couldn't see down into from where they stood in the forest. And between them and the hole were slender men, and ships.

"That clears away any suspicions Scsh-e, those are the swails right there". Rainy said turning to her.

"What's this about Swails and ships? I thought the swails were the people who sent you away?" Blub asked, confused.

"We'll have to explain later Blub, I think that we might get answers if we can find out what's in that hole" Scsh-e said to the others. 

Across the ashen plain they could see the slender beings loading and unloading rocks and other equipment into the three ships, or swails, that were out on the field. From her training scsh-e recognized the ships as a similar class of scout ship to her own, but not equipped for interplantary travel. The engines on these ships were smaller, built for fast travel around planets--clearly there was a larger ship nearby and Scsh-e had a sense it was most likely what lay in the hole on the other side. But how to reach it? There were slender men all over the area and she a feeling they would not be keen on the groups arrival.

The three of them were slowly making their way through the forest when, ahead of them, hidden behind a tree, they ran into one of the lizards of pause.

"Look" it said, pointing out towards the volcano and the woods that they had just come from. 

Blub shivered a bit as he saw the low slinking figures coming out of the forest. Low to the ground they moved with speed. The claws were particularly unsettling to Blub because in the past they had been such a bane for him, but now in the daylight he could see that they were also physically repulsive. Their legs moved with an uncanny jerking motion, rising slightly above their body at the shoulders and haunches. They had a certain grace at times, especially when they would raise their body and neck up to look out into the distance, but that would fade suddenly when Blub would see a flash of their claws through the ashes.

"Perhaps the claws, like the rest of us, finally feel the pressure from the destruction caused by the fires..." the lizard leader said, perhaps to himself. The rest of the group  now surrounded by a number of lizards who had appeared from behind leaves and branches to watch, held their breath and waited to see what would unfold.

*************************
** 14: GOZ **
***************************** 

The Slender men didn't see the claws coming through the grass until they were largely surrounded, and when they did see them it was in cries of pain. The attacks were sudden, a scream in one part of the plain, and then a slender man would vanish into the tall grass growing up out of the ashes. One by one they would let out a yell and vanish--others, startled by the situation looked around for their assailants, but seeing nothing retreated slowly towards the ships. It was only a matter of seconds before the field was empty, perhaps a dozen slender men had disappeared without a fight. The claws, clearly, were prepared and coordinated for this. The ships, warned perhaps by the screams and yells, took off as soon as their pilots saw what was happening. They skimmed the plain low to the ground making a humming noise as their gravity engines held them aloft. The two ships that managed to leave the ground quickly gained speed and moved out towards the north, probably to the ice fields and mines that Rainy had mentioned the night before --one ship, its cargo bay still open and being loaded, remained grounded, its pilot presumably killed as well. There was very little noise now. From a distance the group could occasionally see a claw passing from one patch of grass to another, or pulling the body of a slender man away from the area they had been in. It became clear after a moment that the claws were dragging the bodies off and back towards the woods they had come from. The group stayed quiet and waited until all of the claws they could see had vanished into the foliage and the plains were empty and quiet again.

"You know, I'm really glad we came down off that mountain now, we wouldn't stand a chance against those things. Monsters." Rainy said to the others

"I agree" Blub said, before adding "I propose we take the long road around to the hole and go all the way to the far side of the plains, where the fires are."

"Fine with me." Scsh-e threw in, a little shell-shocked from the scene that had unfolded.

"Well, good luck" the leader of the lizards said "We'd ... like to know what's going on here, but when ... it comes to ... claws, we'll take no part in .... it. It's too bad that ... those gizzards you were looking for ... are all dead now, I suppose you ... didn't ... run into any on the mountain?"

"Sorry--what did you say?" scsh-e said, turning quickly to the lizard

"The gizzards--that's what we called them, since they came out of GOZ"

"What?" asked Rainy "Why didn't you tell us that before?"

"You didn't ... ask? Go look for yourselves--the claws are gone and it will be dark soon anyways. GOZ certainly hasn't gone anywhere."

"Let's go--I need to know" Said Scsh-e, looking at Rainy and Blub. And so they set out along the forest edge, working their way closer to the fire before crossing out into the ashen plane. The plains here were burned more recently and the grass had yet to grow back. The smoke too was thick and Scsh-e pulled her mask up rather than breath the noxious fumes. She showed Blub how to mount his own mask, and Blub in turn gave Rainy a sheet of fabric to cover his nose. They worked their way across the plains, with the fire out to their right sending huge columns of ash into the sky, and the lone slender man ship out to their left. The plain was larger than it had seemed from a distance and after a long walk Blub stopped them, about midway out to the huge gaping hole that they were approaching, GOZ, as the lizards had called it, was not yet visible. "Should we take a look at their ship scsh-e?" Blub asked "I haven't seen anything move there since we started moving again, and its getting dark". Indeed, the sun had set without them noticing due to the thick layer of smoke that clung over the plains. There had been a steady dimming of the light, but the full moon had come up over the horizon and they could still well despite the smoke. 

"I would like to--I want to know what these ships are" in her head she continued her though, "they don't seem like mine--and they definitely aren't equipped for space travel... so GOZ has to be a ship that brought them here." She kept mulling these thoughts over, looking for an explanation for why she would have been sent to scout a system where there were already people as they came closer to the ship. There were signs of struggles all around them--blood stains covered the ashes, and there were long lines of ash leading out to the forest where the claws had dragged the bodies of the slender men away. Around them there were piles of various ores, mined out of the north, as well as forged rings of metal and other parts that the slender men seemed to be constructing. There were also larger pieces of metal--huge flat pieces which seemed damaged, and parts that had clearly been repaired and patched. The area seemed like it had been a workshop for the slender men.

"Look over here!" called Rainy, from behind the back bay of the ship. Scsh-e and Blub moved over, examining the ship on the way. It was indeed a planetary variant of her own scout ship, equipped with an engine capable of hovering but without the warp engines that let her own ship escape a planet's gravity and cross through the emptiness of space. Instead, it had a larger hold which was right now taken up by two large pieces of the silvery gray metal that was being repaired around them on the plains. Rainy, pointing to the front of the ship from outside said, "Look at the pilot--I think he's alive still, he must have killed the claw that attacked him". "Jeeze, I'll stay here I'm not one for getting into any fights." said Blub. Scsh-e looked at Rainy and asked "There's no room for you with these pieces of steel, I'll go take a look.". "Be careful, please" Rainy asked.

So scsh-e walked up the ramp and into the access bay, slowly working her way towards the cockpit. Even from a distance she could already hear the rasping sound of breathing, amplified by her suits external sensors. She found the dead claw at the front of the bay. It was a monstrous thing after all, huge sinewy legs giving way to four massive claws on each front paw, right now covered in blood. A hole had been ripped out of its neck and it was clearly gone now, its eyes a dull gray. Her suit identified it as an organic being--and quite clearly dead.  Scsh-e stepped around the dead body, still wary, and looked into the cabin at one of the slender men, rasping for breath.

"Hello? Are you still alive?" Scsh-e asked, tentatively

"What? Who are you?" the slender man responded. It turned slightly to its right, craning to peer back out of the pilot seat--but a sharp intake of breath and pain forced it to turn to face forward again. It merely added: "Who are you."

"I'm scout E, sent to..."

"A scout? Hahaha" the slender man laughed and then coughed, roughly. "This whole system was supposed to be scouted for us--where have you been all these years."

"I don't understand--I just arrived, there was a malfun..."

"It doesn't matter. Scout. It's too late--our mission is a failure. Our ship is destroyed, the colonizers are trapped in stasis, and we were the last ship sent out."

"What are you talking about?"

"They don't teach you scouts anything do they. Worthless servants..." the slender man paused breathing slowly for a minute, his breath slowing slightly.

"I'm going to die. But I will fill you in--why not."

*************************
** 15: Home **
*************************

What they don't tell you scouts is that you are part of a doomed race. Long ago we were a healthy species, intelligent, confident, we spread out from our home planet over years and slowly built bases on the other planets in our solar system. We were masters of space travel. Our species flourished for millenia in our solar system and the planets nearby all the while aware that the sun we depended on vitally for energy and life was dying. It was in part our own fault, in our search for a limitless source of energy with which to travel to other galaxies and star system we tried to harness the sun directly. We built power plants that went inside the core of the sun and pulled energy straight out and beamed it to us on other planets... We don't know what happened exactly but it cause the sun to shift and begin to go supernova, in essence we aged it by a billion years. When we first found out our species began to make plans to escape of course and sent ships out as best as we could, but those ships, the first colony ships, would need hundreds or thousands of years to arrive at any useful destination, even then they could only save the smallest fraction of our population. It took hundreds of years, thousands even, of our best scientists to arrive at a solution, they created the "warp". I imagine you warped to this solar system just as we did. It was an imperfect solution--an idea only partially understood by our greatest minds and even less by the population. But in theory we could send ships nearly instantly across the universe, but at huge cost. The energy expenditure was gigantic, even for a small ship, and a single warp for a minor ship often required stockpiling energy for months.

It took decades to build the galaxy orbiters and to stockpile enough energy in batteries to launch them through the warp and by that time our sun was already beginning to go supernova, encroaching on the planets at the core of our solar system. We evacuated those early on and focused, our entire society, on building the colony ships. Billions of people with one entire purpose.

"You'll forgive me for overlooking some details, Scout, I don't have much time, and my suit is unable to contain the damage..."

As you know, when the galaxy orbiter program was first started we also made plans to scout out solar systems far away. Early on in the warp technology we were unable to warp large organisms like ourselves. Out of concner, and as you must be aware we warped space stations with test-tube children on them, like yourself. Many of us were disgusted by the idea of such an unnatural birth, but it was the only safe way to put scouts into far away solar systems. Your station should have been activated years ago, but clearly it malfunctioned and you were born years later than you should have been. I can see that our later upgrades did arrive though, like that exploration suit--an earlier version than the ones we eventually deployed but nonetheless a huge advantage over previous bulky designs. In any case, the scouts were sent out hundreds of years before the colony ships were built in the hopes that when they arrived each system would be catalogued and the best planets identified for colonization. 26 solar systems with over a hundred potential viable planets... 26 colony ships that were built, each with one hundred colonists.

To maximize energy collection we continued to collect energy until the last possible moment, the supernova sun coming within a few hundred thousand miles of our construction array. It had to be built close enough to collect a dense concentration of solar energy, but far enough to survive sufficiently long to power the warp. As I understand it the calculation was off--we had insufficient power to launch. We have no idea what happened to the other ships of course, there's no communication possible between the solar systems unless somebody warps between them, but our ship arrived damaged. By our calculations all of the other ships have suffered the same fate.

Entire pieces of the ship had been left behind as insufficient energy accelerated us through the warp field. Our life support systems allowed us engineers to survive, but the colonists on our ship were wiped out in stasis. Upon arrival our ship immediately went into emergency mode and crash landed on the most viable planet it could identify, and we have desperately attempted to repair the warp system since then. We though if we retrofitted these exploration vehicles with interplanetary engines we could warp to one of the systems where the other colony ships are, perhaps there the colonists survived and we could help built a new world, but... we've been unsuccessful. Our warp is intact and apparently functional, evacuated into orbit around the sun while the galaxy orbitor crashed, over the last few years it has collected sufficient energy to warp multiple ships, but we won't have a chance to go there. Our experience with the local fauna has been.... unsuccessful. Their intelligence is low, so we attempted to trade food with them in exchange for help finding the pieces of our ship that broke off during our crash landing--scattered all over this damn continent. It took years, and the years took their toll. Many of us engineers weren't meant to survive for long here, simply put in place the tools for the colonists and then make room for them... but here we are, years later. At first we all worked together, engaging the seals and penguins we found in the arctic to mine ores for our repairs, and we burned down vast tracts of forest in an effort to find all of the parts we lost. We've gathered many of them together here and we were making repairs when these stupid slinking animals, like that one that killed me, started attacking us. They destroyed our foundries on the mountain and they've hassled us endlessly. You know the rest...

Oh... I almost forgot... some of us engineers splintered off. They wanted to stay here and survive rather than warp to another system. They're still out there on the planet, probably in the arctic now. Occasionally they raided the galaxy orbiter for supplies but they've mostly lived in the arctic, collecting gear and building up colonies. A few fights broke out recently... apparently they equipped their seals as an army, something stupid like that, and stole our mines.. but it doesn't much matter now. Those two ships that flew away are the last two of us engineers who will survive... I don't know what they'll do now but they won't be able to find the rest of missing parts even with all the fires that we set these last few days, there just isn't enough time anymore. And those claws... why would they attack us like that? They hunt those jungle people normally not us...

The slender man went quiet for a moment and then, anger flashing through her eyes, Scsh-e put a metal spike through his body from the back of the chair.  His body convolused for a second and then went limp as he looked down at the spike, blood dripping down over his body. The spike retracted suddenly and the slender man collapsed onto the floor, his suit, irreperably damaged, flashed warning lights and then sealed itself. In emergencies like this the suits were designed to act as a tomb, in case future exporeres foud the body, but more practically to limit the mess a dead body made. Scsh-e looked disgusted at the body one last time and then turned to leave. 

As she left the pilot room and went back past the claw to the rear of the ship she thought about the story. She had stood through it with increasing distaste, at the complete lack of care they had given to the planet they arrived on, the nonchalance with which they had set the fires, burning down huge swaths of land just so they could leave the planet, destroyed and wrecked behind them. Almost unintentionally she had slipped one of the two long metal spikes out of her bag and onto her arm... But worst of all she felt disgusted now at her eown species, she barely knew them but all she had learned was of their destruction of a star system, and their plans to destroy 26 more. And yet, her impulsive act left her without answers to other questions, but there were still at least a dozen slender men on the planet who might be able to answer those.

** 16: The Warp ****
********************

Outside, Rainy and Blub were standing together examining some of the parts the slender men were repairing. They came over as soon as they heard scsh-e coming back. 

"Well I spoke with one." she told them.

"You spoke with one?" Rainy asked, looking incredulous

"Yes--he told me what they were doing here..." Scsh-e hesitated, choosing not to tell them the entire history of her culture, and jump to the point quickly. "They were here to take over this planet, but I guess the ship that's down in that hole, GOZ, was damaged so they can't. Instead they're trying to escape to another planet where there are other colonizers."

Blub and Rainy looked at each other for a moment, then back at scsh-e, Blub asked her "So what do we do now?"

Rainy looked at them both and said "Well when those ships took off I assume those slender men went back up north?"

"That's right" Scsh-e answered

"Then we should get rid of them. Are they the last ones here?"

"No. There are more, but how many I'm not sure. In any case, I think GOZ is the answer to finding out. The ship, if it's anything like mine, can track the slender men that are on the planet now."

"Sounds like a plan" Blub said, turning towards the hole.

The three of them took off, crossing the open plane as the sun, barely visible through the clouds of smoke above them, began to settle. The fires, off to their right and to the east, continued to burn, but farther now than they had earlier in the day. They crossed the plain and then suddenly, at the top of a small rise near the edge of the crater, they saw the ship. It was perhaps two hundred feet long, a compact machine, with a cockpit visible in the front and many small engines at the rear. Half of the ship was submerged in the depths of the crater, while the visible half formed a cylindrical dome above the ground. It appeared that the ship had landed engines first and then tipped, as it lay part way up the side of the crater closest to them. The group began the hike down and found themselves dropping into the huge hole, winding through boulders and broken rock towards the cockpit, where they could see a hole in the hull. Their path down only took a few minutes, dropping perhaps five hundred feet down the rocky walls. As they hiked down they kicked endless cascades of rocks down into the bowl, and dust added to the clouds of smoke already lingering in the crater. Within minutes they arrived at the hole. The hole was formed by the panels that had been removed and were under repair up at the craters edge, and allowed the group to enter unimpeded into the control room of the ship. Many of the controls looked identical to those in SCSH-E's own ship, and the ship indeed must have recognized her suit or Blub's as it chimed to life, lights flashing on control panels and damaged screens.

"Take a look at the rest of the ship, we might learn something interesting. I'll take care of finding the other slender men" scsh-e told the others, already sitting down in front of an accessible set of controls. Blub and Rainy passed through the control room downward into a sub-level while she turned her attention to the screen. Quickly she accessed the reports system and brought to life one of the undamaged screen, where it showed the location of the two other ships, apparently they had flown west and out to the desert. In addition it brought up a set of video screen monitors, showing her the inside of GOZ. She saw Blub and Rainy descending ladders into the lower parts of the ship where the colonizers would still be trapped in stasis, presumably killed during the warp. The screens also brought up a series of logs of previous events. Scsh-e flipped through them quickly, watching video of the ship as it came down onto earth, twisting wildly out of control, due to malfunctioning control systems. She flipped ahead to a video of the control room she was in, watching the engineers come out of it the first time, dismantling the broken panels as small fires burned throughout the crater. She also found recorded video saved from the suits showing the slender men setting fires and then returning to recover broken pieces of their ship that had fallen off during landing. Eventually, disgusted, she turned the screens off. At that moment Blub and Rainy returned.

"There's only a few rooms scsh-e, this control room, a living area, an engine room, and a holding space, filled with all of these coffin-like things" Blub reported, "Those are the colonizers, apparently they died in transit" Scsh-e told them. 

"The rest of the ship is pretty stripped, I don't think the slender men stay here at night, all the gear is gone" Rainy added, "I don't think there's much for us here."

"No--we can still try to find where the slender men are now. They might be communicating over the ships communication system, we could listen in" scsh-e said, turning some dials and tuning the radio across the available channels. At first there was only static and then suddenly a voice came through, as clear as if they were in the same room:

"Look over there--on that sand dune, that must be it."

A second voice came through

"That's it--that must be the scout's ship, I hope it isn't damaged or we'll have to go back to GOZ and get parts."

"Let's land over that rise and walk, just in case there's a second scout."

Blub and Rainy looked at Scsh-e, alarmed, "You're the only scout on the planet, right?" 

"As far as I know--" scsh-e looked at them, "They could steal the ship and go to the warp--we can't let them do that!"

"What can we do from here?" Blub asked

"Nothing--but the ship is broken, they'll find out quickly enough, and the spare parts are here on this ship. If we're careful we can avoid them when they fly back, and get back on my ship. But we have to move! It won't take them long to figure out that the engines are broken on my ship."

"I'll take you to the engine room, there were spare parts there, it looked like everything was under repair" Rainy added, quickly moving back to the ladder and down.

Within minutes they were back outside, rushing up the hillside as quickly as the three of them could move. Blub carried the spare parts, the bolts that had broken in Scsh-e's engine, which were carried up by his suit at no cost to him. Retracing their steps they rushed back to the remaining ship. They arrived just as the first hints of sunlight spread out over the sky behind them. 

"Blub, Rainy, you empty the hold of the spare panels, they'll only slow us down. I'll move the claw and the dead slender man. Quickly!" Scsh-e yelled, moving swiftly to the front of the ship.

It took them another fifteen minutes, as the sun slowly crept up over the horizon, to empty the hold. Eventually the two panels lay out in the ashes and the two bodies were hidden under some tarps they found nearby. Scsh-e took over the controls, which she found similar to the ones on her own ship. The craft, supported by its gravity engines, came up off the ground silently. Blub had taken the co-pilot seat where he felt reasonably comfortable in his first flying experience, but Rainy was left unharnassed in the hold, terrified at every moment of the ship. 

Expertly, scsh-e guided the ship across the open plain and out towards the volcanic mountain. She covered the same ground that took them a days travel in five minutes, and put the craft down in a dark area near the forest's edge. She turned the engines off and watched the radar for any sign of movement. The three of them sat in silence, waiting for a sign of movement. Eventually Blub spoke up, "If they have no choice to return then we'll certainly get to the ship first. But what do we do next?"

"We should go to the arctic, and get the slender men out of there!" Rainy said, his head laying down through the opening from the hold. "I want to see my people free again."

"I don't know if that's the right thing to do..." Blub said, looking concerned, "We haven't even seen these slender men try to defend themselves, but I imagine they can."

"I'm sure they will be prepared for us if we take the ship and they return to find it gone." Scsh-e said. "But I agree with Rainy, we have to do something."

"Look! The radar" Rainy said, pointing a huge flipper at a pair of dots that had appeared suddenly. The three sat and watched as the ships passed, out of sight in the distance, on a straight line towards GOZ. As soon as they were out of radar range Scsh-e took their ship up into the air and, at full throttle, raced towards the desert. Above them the sun blazed bright down around them. Their ship flew over the forest and within minutes they crossed the river. From this height they could see icebergs floating down from the north, as well as the ominous fires burning in the distance around them in every direction. They crossed the desert quickly and Scsh-e, retracing her steps past the scannons homes, found her ship quickly. She landed beside it and they rushed back out of the hold, repair gear in hand. Scsh-e found the inside of her ship untouched by the slender men, although they had clearly passed through leaving things open and unlocked. She moved swiftly into the engine room, Blub following her as far as he could in his bulky suit, and then passing the bolts necessary for repair through behind her. Rainy stayed in the cockpit, watching the radar. The fix took only a few minutes, but that was already too long, from the front of the ship she heard Rainy yell back "Scsh-e! Blub! There is a ship on the radar!"

"Damn!" Scsh-e said--the fix was done, but now there would be only one way to escape. Her ship would be too slow to outrun the faster gravity drive ships, so they had to go up--perhaps all the way to space. She wormed her way back into the pilot seat while Blub sat on the ground behind her and Rainy moved himself into the living area. This ship having no hold large enough for Rainy. "I can see them!" Blub said, pointing in the distance, as one of the gravity drive ships, now visible to the naked eye, flew in over the sand dunes.

"Let's get out of here!" Scsh-e said, punching coordinates into her drive system. It hummed to life and then, in a sudden blast of acceleration and sand, shot out of the desert and into the sky, passing straight over the other ship. The acceleration sent Rainy crashing backward in the ship, swearing, and Blub too was thrown against the wall. But the acceleration only last a few seconds and then gave way to a sight they had never seen. The horizon dropped below them, just the same as when they climbed up the volcano, but then unexpectedly the blue sky gave way to the black of space. As the ship rose and escaped gravity Scsh-e rotated the ship so that the windows faced down onto the planet.

"My gosh..." Blub exclaimed. "That is something" Rainy added.

Scsh-e smiled a bit before telling the others, "That's it, we're safe now--even if they have weapons they can't reach us in orbit. So we can decide what to do next... But now that we're here, I'm not sure we should go back."

Blub, breaking his reverie for a moment turned to Scsh-e, "What? But what about the slender men, they've destroyed our whole planet! We have to go back."

"Yes--I won't leave my people behind!" Rainy added, adamantly. 

"I know--but what I didn't tell you before is that these weren't the only slender men, there is a gate here in orbit--in fact it's up there just ahead of us, see it on the radar here." She pointed out a dot on the radar, that they were slowly cathing up to, " that gate is a link to the other colony ships. Even if we kill the slender men here, more will come eventually. This planet is too ideal for them." Scsh-e told them, ahead, Orbiting a bit slower than them, the gate itself now came into full sight.

"And for now they're trapped, isn't that right?" Blub said "They don't have any ships that can go to space."

"That's right. The only way to make this planet safe is to use the warp... and make sure nobody else can come destroy this planet!"

"Sounds like an adventure?" Rainy said.

"Yes. There are 26 colony ships. Most probably crashed, but we'll have to make sure."

"So where do we go first?" Blub asked

"We pick one at random I suppose", Scsh-e said. The gate, now aligned with the ship, was accessible through her control panels. She chose a set of coordinates and punched them in. The warp suddenly went dark, the stars on the far side disappearing from visibility and replaced with an odd opaque darkness.

"That's it." Scsh-e said, are you ready?

"You're sure we'll be able to come back?" Rainy asked.

"Yes--my ship can warp on its own, but it would take longer. This is our best option."

And so the ship, SCout SHip-E, launched into the warp and disappeared, flung far far away to a solar system across the galaxy.
