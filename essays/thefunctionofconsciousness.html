<p>
&ensp;If you ask the average person about consciousness, or do a quick search on the internet, you'll discover that "consciousness" is a mysterious and poorly defined concept that we may never truly understand. This is at once unsurprising and alarming. Unsurprising because for the last three millenia philosophers have debated what exactly consciousness is and how it might work--with little apparent progress. Alarming because rapid advances in neuroscience may finally have given us clues to an answer. In the style of Marr I believe that understanding consciousness means understanding three levels: what function consciousness solves for organisms, the algorithm that the brain uses to evoke consciousness, and finally the implementation at the level of neurons. I think that there is evidence for each level coming from evolution, artifical neural networks, and neuroscience respectively to support the ideas I will present here. But before we can undertake a study of consciousness we need to carefully define the item of interest.
<br>
&ensp;Philosophers have struggled with a definition of consciousness for a very long time but I think that we can appeal our intuitions before we turn to philosophy. We all have feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and emotions. Some of these can be recalled as memories, while some are only transient. These events (often called qualia) occur during waking life and to some extent while dreaming and perhaps in a coma, but are absent in humans under anesthesia, in deep sleep, seizure, and the absence of brain activity. As a most salient example of what consciousness is and what the absence of consciousness I would ask the reader to turn their attention to the visual world infront of them and to contrast this with the world that they cannot see behind them. Consciousness consists of the perceptions, generated by your mind from incoming sensory information, of the world infront of you. In contrast, you have no conscious perceptions about the world behind you (to the extent that you are not invoking memory or relying on hearing, etc). For all the limited percepts we have of the world in front of us we are unconscious of vastly more, both external and internal. The process of coming to a decision, generating motor movements, and combining the disassembled parts of a face (such as the eyes, nose, and mouth) all occur without the slightest conscious experience.
