&ensp;Evolution relies on two simple rules: inheritance and mutation. You might add a third rule, that survival has to be difficult, but together evolution results in change over time, often in what appears to be a particular "direction" or for a "function". This is why we interpret our eyes as being for seeing, when in fact our eyes are simply a very complicated series of mutations of simpler eyes which gave some predecessor of ours an advantage in surviving. This story is also less romantic. So what I want to think about in this essay is the <i>function</i> of consciousness. We have subjective experiences about the world. We perceive and can act on these perceptions (or so we feel). And like all aspects of our organism this feature must have evolved. Because it isn't a specious part of us like the appendix with no apparent value and because it costs a significant amount of energy (neurons eat glucose like mad), it probably has some value--but what?
<br>
&ensp;To kill the punchline early I think the answer is that consciousness is best thought of us a workspace where all inputs can be considered equally. Think of the following problem: you are a fish with two sensors, you can feel vibrations in the water and you can see with your rudimentary eyes when the light above you is being blocked. You've learned (presumably on an evolutionary scale) that both of these signals are a sign that a predator is approaching to eat you and that you should move away. One solution to this problem is to hard code the directions that you should move, so for each input direction there is a corresponding movement along the same vector. This is problematic for a number of reasons, but one obvious one is that when there are multiple sources of information with conflicting motor outputs you get trapped. A second issue is that if your motor output sends you into a wall, again, you're trapped. So this is an okay solution if you don't mind having heavy losses--and evolution doesn't "mind", but it tends to improve on things quite quickly so if conscious does anything it can do more than this trivial solution. So now imagine you are getting two conflicting signals, you feel (vibrations) on one side, and you see a shadow on the other side. You could have a neural system dedicated to resolving these conflicts
