People often wonder about where biology is headed and how humans ended up the way we are. I consider the answer to this question to be a fundamental piece of knowledge that you need to grasp if you want to understand of biology--which includes psychology, the social sciences, etc. The answer is of course evolution but I would guess that, like me, the early explanations of evolution you got were based around very specific rules like the need for mutations in genes, the structure of DNA, and competition between species. But that really isn't evolution at all and I hope to convince you here that the evolution you learned about is really just a good example of a much more general principle in the universe, which has a lot to do with entropy. Off we go!
<br><br>
Imagine for a moment that you are a chicken and that you lay eggs. You lay eggs because they turn into baby chickens, and those baby chickens grow up to lay more eggs with more baby chickens, and so on. So it goes, as some might say. Now, along comes a fox who likes to eat eggs whenever it can. The fox is afraid of chickens, but when the chickens need to leave their eggs to gather food, he strikes! If you were a lucky chicken you might get a blast of radiation one day, mutating your egg laying capabilities such that your eggs hatch faster. All else being equal, your chick children would be more likely to survive, since they would hatch faster and thus be susceptible to consumption by the fox less often. This story as I've laid out is the standard story of evolution that you get taught in class and it's all true. But what I want to convince you about here is that just as much as evolution applies to this system of chickens, eggs, and fox, it also applies to systems like rivers and streams, or planets and solar systems. This is a good time to get a bit disgruntled, put a frown on your face, and say "Hey Dan, what the fuck are you talking about?", so let me explain.
<br><br>
There is a generic feature of the chicken/egg/fox system that often gets ignored and this is the ecological niche. A niche is a basically the way that an organism acquires energy (food), the pressures that are placed upon it by outside influences (predators, etc), and how that organism pressures others. Note that I use "organism" here, but let me rephrase this in a more general way: a niche is a description of the closed system describing how a system decreases its local entropy against an overall increases in entropy outside of the local system. For anybody not familiar with entropy let me dig into that a bit more. Entropy is a way of talking about the order and disorder of the universe. Basically, there are more ways for the universe to be disordered than ordered, so if some event occurs that causes the universe to change, its more likely to end up in a disordered state than to stay in an ordered one. Or another way to say this in terms of eggs, if you drop an egg there are very few ways for the egg to land and not break, a broken egg is more disordered, so over time if you occasionally drop eggs, it's guaranteed that things are going to get broken. But, you can decrease entropy temporarily in a local region of space as long as you increase the entropy a bit extra on the outside, and this is what a niche is all about. A niche is simply an opportunity in the universe for some <i>thing</i>, be it just a cloud of gas, a rock, or whatever, to create a bit more order in the universe temporarily until disorder takes back over. So what does this have to do with evolution? Well, remember those rules we talked about? They come into play here, even though there might not be any organisms around to talk about them.
<br><br>
So we've imagined a niche that exists out there, some opportunity to get a bit of extra energy and turn that into order. Perhaps it's as simple as
