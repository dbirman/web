						&ensp;If you ask the average person about consciousness, or do a quick search on the internet, you'll discover that "consciousness" is a mysterious and poorly defined concept that we may never truly understand. This is at once unsurprising and alarming. Unsurprising because for the last three millenia philosophers have debated what exactly consciousness is and how it might work--with little apparent progress. Alarming because it seems like something as essential to our lives should be clarified in a bit more detail. In the style of Marr I believe that understanding consciousness means understanding three levels: what function consciousness solves for organisms, the algorithm that the brain uses to evoke consciousness, and finally the implementation at the level of neurons. I think that there is evidence for each level coming from evolution, artifical neural networks, and neuroscience respectively to support the ideas I will present here. But before we can undertake a study of consciousness we need to carefully define the item of interest.
						<br><br>
						&ensp;A useful way to operationalize consciousness is to think about what consciousness allows. Some information makes it into consciousness while other information remains unconscious. Importantly, conscious access to information appears to allow us to do a whole slew of things: verbal reports, storing in memory, use for abstract thoughts, drive arbitrary actions, etc. Unconscious access to information seems to drive a different set of behaviors including stereotyped or overlearned actions and changes in emotional state. A useful tool to think about the effect of consciousness is that there are a set of behaviors which can be taken (listed above) based on the current information contained in the "conscious field". When overlearned these same behaviors can be taken based on a particular stimulus input, but in the absence of extensive learning they are only accessible to particular sets of content in the conscious field.
