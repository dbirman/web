&ensp;I once got into a surprising argument with a friend about the possibility of the existence of ghosts. The surprise came from my prior belief that students of science were unlikely to believe in ghosts, gods, and other superstitions--a prior which I now believe is quite incorrect. In fact a considerable number of serious and impressive scientists are also extremely religious. Where does this discrepency come from? How do these people, who rely on logic to guide their research, allow beliefs in the absence of evidence to drive their person? I believe this comes from the difficulty our minds have in processing and understanding probability.
<br><br>
&ensp;So let's examine the possibility of your believing in ghosts in more detail. First, let's simplify whether or not you believe in ghosts into two parts: whether you have any personal evidence for ghosts to exist, and whether you have any friends who believe in ghosts. Now, the vast majority of people on earth probably do not have first person evidence for the existence of ghosts--but there also exists a vocal minority of people who do. Let's assume for a moment that all of these people are actually experiencing delusions, due either to hallucinations, drugs, or just wishful interpretation of dreams and other strange experiences. There are plenty of such people to go around, since schizophrenia can induce these kinds of hallucinations, as well as drug use, etc. Let's make a small assumption now about the prevalance of these people in the world. Using personal experience as a guide we can get a rough estimate for their existence, in my own life I may have encountered a dozen of these people, of perhaps ten thousand people who I have interacted with. That puts their proportion at about .01%, which doesn't seem unreasonable. That also suggests that across the entire population of the world there are an astounding number of these people, close to 1 million in total. So our baseline for personal evidence regarding ghosts is that about 1 million people will have these beliefs, in the complete absence of any real ghosts.
<br><br>
&ensp;Now your likelihood of having some such a belief is not just a property of personal belief but also the influence of your friends. Let's put the likelihood of spreading a belief at 10%. In other words, for every ten people that a true believer is close friends with, they will convince one of them. The average person has a network of about 150 friends and family over their lifetime, so we can say that a true believer will convince about fifteen people. These secondary believers are probably far less convincing, so let's assume that they only spread the belief to half as many people, and so on. So a true believer's reach extends only in a chain of about 3-4 people (5%, 2.5%, 1.25%, 0.5%) before essentialy dropping to zero.  Again we need to make some simplifying assumptions here, such that people aren't appearing or disappearing in our model of the world, but let's ignore those issues for now. The question now is what is the probability that a random person will be convinced by a friend, or a friend-of-a-friend, that ghosts exist. Without modeling the interactions between probabilities this is a straightforward calculation:
<br><br>
1 million true believers<br>
15 million secondary believers (15 * #true believers)<br>
~100 million tertiary believers (7.5 * #secondary)<br>
~375 million quaternary believers (3.75 * #tertiary)<br>
~a lot of five-removed
<br><br>
&ensp;That last group is likely to largely consist of people who see "ghost" stories on TV or in the news and take them to be true, or read secondhand accounts in books published by sources closer to the original true believers. In any case, these numbers still suggest that a number of people larger than the population of the united states are likely to believe in ghosts based only on the hallucinations and delusions of schizophrenics, with no true evidence for ghosts necessary.
<br><br>
&ensp;In this version of the argument we don't need to turn to evidence against the existence of ghosts or wishy-washy arguments about why we don't need ghosts to explain strange phenomena. Instead what we've done is built what is called a generative model for belief in ghosts and then evaluated (at a qualitative level) whether the model fits well to the data that we have about belief in ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. Obviously there are some free parameters here, such as the rate of spread and the initial likelihood of being a true believer, which affect the final conclusion. Ideally these numbers would be sourced from surveys and experimental results, perhaps easily found in the social psychology literature.
