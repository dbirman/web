							<h2>Being Social and Conscious, a letter to Binji</h2>

<p>
Dear Binji, thanks for the excellent letter and intriguing thoughts. There's a lot of great ideas in here and I should devote plenty of time to them, but you've already stated them nicely! So instead I'll just go on the attack and see how much damage I can do :). I see a short list of things that I want to address, which I'll outline here and then go into detail about.
<ul>
	<li>
		First, I take issue with the idea that a computational model of conscious experience is "as simple as" W->P->X->D->G->A. In particular, I think this is a classic example of a model that attempts to sidestep the hard problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		Second, I agree that the fundamental counter-argument to your approach is to argue that the first person perspective takes precedence. I disagree with your conclusion that percepts are inherently social--I think that categorical labels are social, but percepts are individual experiences.
	</li>
	<li>
		Third, you make an argument that the human evolutionary niche is inherently social. I agree, but I think there are some nuances to go into. For example you say "When we consider our own experience and the most important drivers of what we feel, neuron level impacts of psychoactive chemicals and food are much less impactful than our experience of social systems, and the environment" whereas I think these are one and the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, I think that there is a semantics issue here which should be addressed. I believe a perception is a first person experience because it is possible, in complete isolation of external stimuli, to generate a "hallucination" of all conscious percepts. That doesn't prevent a perception from being socially influenced, but it guarantees that social influence is not a complete predictor of any experience.
	</li>
</ul>
Before diving in I want to start by taking a cautious step and defining the terms that I plan to use. Not because I think that we necessarily have distinct definitions but rather as an exercise for myself in carefully isolating different concepts. I believe <i>consciousness</i> is a simulation created with the purpose of solving the problem organisms continually face of choosing actions, when multiple possible action choices exist. The <i>conscious field</i> is a frame, defined by its contents, which are structured in relative positions to each other: it has dimensions of space, dimensions of color, dimensions of taste and smell, and so on. A given state of the conscious field will always lead to the same output action, whether that is an internal thought or external motor output. To <i>be conscious</i> of something is to have a percept active in the conscious field, and thus influencing the potential next actions of the organism. Importantly, percepts can be in conflict with each other, for example when are hungry and yet choose to not start eating out of politeness, or under water needing to breath but you choose not to. Why use a conscious field at all? Consciousness, which is the dynamic continuity of the field, is our organism's functional solution to allowing different stimuli that are perceived to exert equal influence on our actions. When we are unconscious, or unconscious of a stimulus, we can only map events on to particular responses. Consciousness allows vastly more complex actions by, for example, combining the stimulus of a face with the knowledge of who that face belongs to, leading to a far larger repertoire of possible action outcomes. As I see it this is a definition, but it lacks of course a solution to the hard problem, and is thus similar in computational usefulness as the mathematical definition that you quoted.
<br><br>
The hard problem will, I imagine, eventually be solved by the discovery that there is a way of simulating things, via computation--whether it be in humans or computers, such that the simulation thus computed experiences qualia. It may turn out that architecture matters but I doubt that <i>atomic structure</i> matters, so silica should be capable of this given the correct architecture. Why does answering the hard problem matter? Without it I think that all definitions of conscious, including the mathematical one quoted, are simply a complex set of input->output mappings. I believe that the hard problem, why qualia are actually experienced, is the core functional importance of consciousness. By putting qualia into a common space they can have an emergent property: they become a new qualia that defines an entirely different set of possible output actions. Any approach that hopes to make light of consciousness
