&ensp;Dear Binji,
I haven't started on this letter until now because I wasn't sure what the right place to start would be. How do we pick one topic out of all the hundreds that we've discussed to open up a written conversation with? Somehow it feels more difficult than letting one appear naturally. So instead of picking something which we've talked about before (which I'm sure we'll get to soon enough) I thought I would start with a new topic that I've spent a lot of time thinking about recently, which is ethics and rights for animals. To provide some structure for our letters I propose we limit ourselves to 1-2k words (~7500 characters) for each iteration. I hope this will turn out to be enjoyable for both of us!
<br>
&ensp;So to start out I want to relate a conversation I recently had with a colleague here at Stanford. We were playing with their cat and someone wondered (as many people often do) about what exactly a cat (or dog, or any other animal) experiences. Having recently read Temple Grandin's book on autism I weighed in with the following comment: Grandin experiences the world with very little abstraction, and she argues that from her experiences with animals she believes that they too do not have the ability to abstract. What she means by abstraction is the following: imagine the word "fear", to you or I we could write out a definition of fear, an emotion which encourages us to escape or flee from a situation. But Grandin explains that she can't do this, to her fear is intrinsically tied to specific memories--and in fact whenever she reads the word "fear" in a book she immediately recalls the first time she experienced the emotion, and then these memories lead to other fearful experiences, etc. When we imagine the experience of an animal we often think that they "think" like we do, so when hungry they might actually say to themselves "I feel hungry", or that when they see their human they might think about them similarly. In contrast, Grandin seems to suggest that when an animal feels hungry they simply remember previous times they were hungry, and might recall that their human feeds them (from specific memories of this occurring), and then they would seek out their human accordingly. The important distinction here being that an animal never says to itself "I'm hungry" or "cold" or "sad", it simply experiences a feeling, recalls a set of associated memories, and then acts based on those memories in an appropriate way.
