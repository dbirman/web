<p>
How should I act? At first glance such a simple question, and yet we've always failed to provide a good answer. This essay is an attempt to lay out my own point of view, mostly for my own benefit.
<br><br>
I'm going to start this essay at the end by saying up front that I believe we should have two main concerns: (1) the continuity, preservation, and expansion of consciousness, and (2) limiting suffering wherever possible. But to understand why I think these are goal that we should act upon we need to take a more circuitous route. In particular we need to establish a number of basic facts about the world and about conscious experience, and I need to convince you that all the claims I make are true. This is a tall order: but let's see how far we can get. Let's begin by trying to make some sense of ourselves as conscious organisms.
<br><br>
<i>I</i> am a brain, creating from moment to moment an illusion of myself in the world, and acting upon that illusion to maximize my selfish evolutionary fitness. Woah! I wish I could stop there but let's carve that up. First of all, we are brains--as much as it feels like you are a body with legs, arms, eyes, etc, you are actually just a simulation that is generated by a brain based on incoming signals from external sensory systems. If we could replace all of your organs with mechanical and computerized versions you would experience the world in largely the same way as you do now. Now on to action: our organism, brain and body, have been honed over evolutionary time to maximize evolutionary fitness. This means that we have been "selected" over time so that given particular situations we will be more likely to make actions that improve the likelihood of passing on our genes. Given this constraint why does your brain bother generating a simulation? Couldn't we just be like computers and simply run an algorithm, sort out the action that best improves our genetic goal, and then continue? The answer is that consciousness, the "perceptions" we have, are an efficient solution to the problem of conflicting actions. Let me proceed by example. Imagine yourself underwater, showing off to your future boy or girlfriend who is off along the sidelines of the pool. As you sit below the water you will experience a number of conflicting perceptions: you will have the perception of increasing carbon dioxide that leads you to want to open your mouth to breath, at the same time you have the perception that your are underwater and that you had better keep your mouth closed, and third and perhaps most important you have the perception that the longer you stay underwater the more your evolutionary fitness will be increased. These perceptions may not all reach consciousness at the same time, they may trade off, but they are all there and they all lead to opposed action plans for your organism. If you were simply a stimulus-response machine you would need to pick amongst these options by determining which had the most value: but which has the most value? How do you compare breathing to drowning to your desire for future offspring? One answer, and the one your brain evolved towards, is to put these perceptions into a common frame of reference. Within this frame of reference all three perceptions can be active at the same time, and their joint activation will determine a single next action. In this way the conscious field allows conflict between action plans to be resolved. To end this section we need to discuss this issue of evolution. All organisms evolved and as much as we appear to be vastly different from other animals, in particular due to our use of abstract knowledge and language, we nevertheless continue to perceive value according to a continuum that is largely determined by evolutionary fitness. Social evolution also exists and occurs at a faster rate than organism evolution, so when multiple organisms work in groups as humans do they will inevitably generate a social fitness continuum which may be at odds with individual evolutionary fitness. So to summarize, we are conscious organisms: a simulation acting to maximize fitness.
<br><br>
In contrast to the image I described above I now want to point out that while humans evolved one way, we didn't evolve the only way. In fact, if you think about it carefully you should come to the conclusion that any possible fitness function can be coded arbitrarily into an organism. Because of evolution organisms on earth value evolutionary fitness, but just among modern humans there are sufficient examples of non-evolutionary-fit individuals to suggest that any value function is possible. This means that immediately we can reach the strong conclusion that there is no universal right or wrong. What I believe is good and what you believe are good are simply relative to our individual fitness functions. This is worrying: it means that in the eyes of Universe (which has no eyes) there is no good or evil, nothing to say that we shouldn't murder for pleasure, or cause suffering for enjoyment. What saves us, and only barely, is that in the presence of energy limits, expanding population, and mutation, organisms will always converge towards the same evolutionary fitness function: a goal of survival until one can pass on genes. For the forseeable future this is the state of affairs. 
<br><br>
As far as we know, other than animals on earth, there aren't any other organisms in the universe that experience consciousness, although there is a high probability that others exist. If we are alone this would be a chilling thought: we are a very simple form of consciousness, and it's likely that there are many more complex forms of consciousness and experiences that can be created, in fact based on the same logic as the preceding paragraph it's quite likely that there are an infinite number of possible experiences to be had. Should it be a goal of conscious beings to expand consciousness to experience these things? I don't have a perfect argument for why that should be, but it seems like a reasonable goal, if only that it might improve our fitness.
