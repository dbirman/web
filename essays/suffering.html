How should I act? At first glance such a simple question, and yet we've always failed to provide a good answer. This essay is an attempt to lay out my own point of view, mostly for my own benefit.
<br><br>
I'm going to start this essay at the end by saying up front that I believe we should have two main concerns: (1) the continuity, preservation, and expansion of consciousness, and (2) limiting suffering wherever possible. But to understand why I think these are goals that we should act upon we need to take a more circuitous route. In particular we need to establish a number of basic facts about the world and about conscious experience, and I need to convince you that all the claims I make are true. Let's begin by trying to make some sense of ourselves as conscious organisms.
<br><br>
<i>I</i> am a brain, creating from moment to moment an illusion of myself in the world, and acting upon that illusion to maximize my selfish evolutionary fitness. To carve that up in more detail: uwe are brains--as much as it feels like you are a body with legs, arms, eyes, etc, you are actually just a simulation that is generated by a brain based on incoming signals from external sensory systems. If we could replace all of your organs with mechanical and computerized versions you would experience the world in largely the same way as you do now. Now on to action: our organism, brain and body, have been honed over evolutionary time to maximize evolutionary fitness. This means that we are the sum of many random variations built up over evolutionary time so that given particular situations we will be more likely to make actions that improve the likelihood of passing on our genes. This is simply a constraint, not a prescriptive algorithm for how we should end up. Given this, why does your brain bother generating a simulation? Couldn't we just be like computers and simply run an algorithm, sort out the action that best improves our genetic goal, and then continue? I believe the answer is that consciousness, the "perceptions" we have, are an efficient solution to the problem of conflicting actions. Let me proceed by example (taken from Morsella et al). Imagine yourself underwater. As you sit below the water you will experience at least two conflicting actions: you will have the perception of increasing carbon dioxide that leads you to want to open your mouth to breath, at the same time you have the perception that your are underwater and that you had better keep your mouth closed. These perceptions may not all reach consciousness at the same time, they may trade off, but they are all there and they all lead to opposed action plans for your organism. If you were simply a stimulus-response machine you would need to pick amongst these options by determining which had the most value: but which has the most value? How do you compare breathing to drowning? One answer, and the one I believe our brains has evolved towards, is to put these perceptions into a common frame of reference. Within this frame of reference both perceptions are active at the same time, and their joint activation will determine a single next action. In this way the conscious field allows conflict between action plans to be resolved. So to summarize, we are conscious organisms: a simulation acting to maximize fitness.
<br><br>
In contrast to the image I described above I now want to point out that while humans evolved one way, we didn't evolve the only way. In fact, I believe you should come to the conclusion that any possible fitness function can be coded arbitrarily into an organism. Because of evolution organisms on earth value niche fitness, but just among modern humans there are sufficient examples of non-niche-fit individuals to suggest that any value function is possible. This means that immediately, given that consciously perceived value is a function of niche-fitness, we can reach the strong conclusion that there is no universal value. In other words, good and evil are relative to our particular brain and its circumstance. What I believe is good and what you believe are good are simply relative to our individual fitness functions. This is worrying: it means that in the eyes of Universe (which has no eyes) there is no true good or evil, nothing to say that we shouldn't murder for pleasure, or cause suffering for enjoyment. What saves us, and only barely, is that in the presence of energy limits, expanding population, and mutation, organisms will always converge towards the same evolutionary fitness function: a goal of survival until one can pass on genes. For the forseeable future this is the state of affairs. Fortunately I see a way out of this non-universal mess, and this is that all organisms that have evolved so far require an internal representation of niche-fitness. This appears both as conscious and unconscious drives, but in our conscious perceptions we have suffering and happiness and many variations thereof. I believe that all organisms that are conscious due to evolution should therefore use the avoidance of suffering as a value function. This is something we do by default to some extent (for ourselves at a minimum, then for family and friends, then for strangers and non-human organisms). This belief is founded on the idea that the preservation of and expansion of consciousness is a goal derived from our shared experience of suffering.
<br><br>
As far as we know, other than animals on earth, there aren't any other organisms in the universe that experience consciousness, although there is a high probability that others exist. If we are alone this would be a chilling thought: we are a very simple form of consciousness, and it's likely that there are many more complex forms of consciousness and experiences that can be created, in fact based on the same logic as the preceding paragraphs it's quite likely that there are an infinite number of possible experiences to be had. Should it be a goal of conscious beings to expand consciousness to experience these things?
