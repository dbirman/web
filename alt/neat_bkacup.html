    <p>I conduct experiments to understand how the brain <i>selects</i> sensory information when you attend. If we understood that, I believe we would be much closer to understanding how the brain creates our conscious experiences.</p>

    <h2 id="dan">About Me</h2>

    <div class="center">

    </div>

    <p>I am a Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.steinmetzlab.net">Nick Steinmetz</a> at <span class="inline-color uw">University of Washington</span>.

    <p>I study attention to understand how different brain areas communicate information to each other. Think about when you walk through Seattle. When you are on a sidewalk you might selectively attend to pedestrians, but while in a crosswalk you might shift your attention to the vehicles around you. I teach mice and humans to perform attention tasks like these, while simultaneously measuring neural activity from throughout the brain. This kind of dataset can then be used to build models of cognition. In my work, this would involve looking at how the brain selects out the important visual information (the pedestrians or cars) and sends that information to decision-making areas.</p>

    <p>For the last few years I have been working on a rock climbing card game with my partner, Allison. We're going to Kickstart it in a few weeks. We think the game is awesome and you should totally support us! </p>
    <p>Check out our website <a href="https://five15game.com">five15game.com</a> where you can learn more about the game, sign up for our mailing list, and get updates!</p>

    <p>Neat is a simple HTML template. It's tiny, opinionated, and made to last. It's created by Joel Dare and heavily inspired by other minimalist sites like <a href="https://100r.co">Hundred Rabbits</a> and dozens of similar blogs.</p>

    <p>Neat is currently 7k (yes kilobytes) including this documentation. It adds only about 1k of overhead to whatever you create and that's not minified or compressed.</p>

    <p>"That's pretty neat!"</p>


    <h2 id="start">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Grab the <em>neat.css</em> and <em>neat.html</em> files.</p>

    <pre><code>curl -O https://neat.joeldare.com/neat.css
curl -O https://neat.joeldare.com/neat.html</code></pre>

    <p>Then copy <em>neat.html</em> to <em>index.html</em> and make your changes. Use <em>neat.html</em> as a reference.</p>

    <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

    <p><em>Neat</em> was designed for.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Blogs</li>
        <li>Journals</li>
        <li>Technical sites</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Simple shops</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="customizing">Customizing</h2>

    <p>It's easy to customize Neat. The best way is to create a new <em>custom.css</em> file and then add the following line to the head of your page.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="custom.css"&gt;</pre>
        
    <p>That will give you the option of updating <em>neat.css</em> without losing any of your personalizations.</p>


    <h2 id="decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

    <p>Neat is opinionated and here are some of the design decisions and the rationale for each of them.</p>

    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>In contrast with the majority of the modern web, Neat was designed to be tiny. A side-effect of being small is that it's also very fast.</p>

    <h3>Low Energy</h3>

    <p>Because it's small and fast it also consumes fewer resources. It should work well even on the slowest connections. Consuming less energy on both the client and the server.</p>

    <h3>Long-Lasting</h3>

    <p>The web is relatively young and technology changes fast but one of the technologies that has lasted as long as the Internet is HTML. There are lots of other interesting formats but plain HTML has a good chance of working well into the future.</p>

    <h3>Not Minified</h3>

    <p>Minified code requires the complexity of a transpiler and makes the site less open for inspection, learning, accessibility, and archive. The size trade-off isn't worth it for Neat.</p>

    <h3>Max Width</h3>

    <p>The body <em>max-width</em> is 800px by default. A thinner column of text is more readable on very large monitors. This is simple to change by editing the <em>max-width</em> of the <em>body</em> element in your <em>custom.css</em> file.</p>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Images are 100% width by default. This works best with images that are wide and short. You can set manual sizes on individual images as it suits you or change the image width in your <em>custom.css</em> if you typically use a different aspect ratio.</p>

    <p>Images have no border by default. This works well for dark colored images but light colored images can get lost. Add something like <code>border: 3px solid #404040</code> if your image needs a border.</p>

    <h3>Left Gutter</h3>

    <p>The left gutter is wider at larger sizes, giving the page a little more breathing room at desktop and tablet sizes.</p> 

    <h3>Buttons are Links</h3>

    <p>It's best to use semantic web tags whenever possible. Buttons are a unique case where you're typically linking somewhere, but the button tag doesn't currently support the href attribute. So, buttons are <em>anchor</em> tags with a <em>class</em> of <em>button</em>. You can also throw a <em>div</em>, with a <em>center</em> class, around them if you want a button centered.</p>

    <pre>&lt;a class="button" href="#"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

    <div class="center">
        <a href="#" class="button">Button</a>
    </div>

    <h3>No Header</h3>

    <p>Because of the complexity of the css and the distraction of navigation, there is no header and no navigation, other than the link back to the home page.</p>

    <h3>Responsive</h3>

    <p>Neat is designed to be responsive.</p>
