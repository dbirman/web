      <description>We had a blast of warm weather at the beginning of February which Greg, Allison, and I took advantage of to take a quick trip up Mt St Helens. We left on a Friday night and camped out at the trailhead (with the other hundred or so people who were there), then got up around 5am for a 6am departure. Because we were car camping we even got to have our favorite breakfast of coffee yogurt (and blueberries) before leaving.</description>
