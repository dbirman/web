<p>The South Side route on Wy&rsquo;east is at the same time a big step up and a big step down from the mellow skiing on the Worm Flows route of the previous week. You start at a ski lodge, and the first half of the south side route is just skiing up past the lifts. It&rsquo;s a bit disheartening to ski for two hours and realize you could have taken a lift the whole way! In total Wy&rsquo;east is about +5300' of elevation gain over just 4 miles.</p>

<p>My friend Alex has skied all the volcanoes in Washington state, but he hasn&rsquo;t done Hood even though it&rsquo;s just an hour south of the border with Oregon. We took a day off on a Friday and blasted down the night before, spending the night in the parking lot of the ski lodge. With the clear and cold weather we had beautiful views of the mountain.</p>
<p>We woke up around 7:00am when people started driving into the parking lot to ski at the actual resort and by 8 or so we were moving up the mountain in a ripping wind! The snow was ice, but the sun was shining and the temperatures were warm which gave us a false sense of hope about the afternoon conditions.</p>

<p>A few boulders sticking out of the snowfield/glacier were great for taking some short breaks behind while we warmed up in the sun. Overall we were pretty optimistic, especially once we got past the top of the lifts.</p>

<p>Compared to Lawetlat&rsquo;la the terrain on Wy&rsquo;east is a completely different nature. In Winter Lwetlat&rsquo;la feels like a huge open ski bowl, you can barely tell that you&rsquo;re on a volcano until you pop out on the summit rim and look down into the massive valley where there used to be a mountain. On Wy&rsquo;east as soon as you get up past the ski resort lifts you pretty quickly get overwhelmed by the smell of sulfur.</p>

<p>That smell comes out of the open crater that you pass on the Hogsback, a pretty crazy fin of snow that separates the two halves of the crater itself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, above the Hogsback we got turned around by the conditions in the pearly gates. It&rsquo;s basically a steep funnel of snow and ice and we had only brought a single ice axe each. Neither of us felt super comfortable on the terrain, especially with the big runout going down into the crater below. Next time we come back we&rsquo;ll have to bring two ice axes each for the extra security!</p>
