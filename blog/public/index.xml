      <description>Lawetlat&amp;rsquo;la is the smallest of the Washington volcanoes but it also has one of the easiest approaches, because the road to the trailhead is plowed, even in winter. To get to the summit is about 5000&#39; of elevation gain and around 5.5 miles each way.
We had a blast of warm weather at the beginning of February which Greg, Allison, and I took advantage of to take a quick trip up Mt St Helens.</description>

      <description>From 2015 to 2018 I flew back and forth at least two dozen times from the San Francisco airport to the Seattle airport to visit Allison. On each of those flights I tried to get a right-hand seat on the flight north and a left-hand seat on the flight south, so that I would get to watch the Cascade volcanoes as they passed by my window. It seemed like it would make such a beautiful trip to drive north and ski as many of the volcanoes as possible, but at the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to ski.</description>
