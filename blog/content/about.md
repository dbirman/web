From 2015 to 2018 I flew back and forth at least two dozen times from the San Francisco airport to the Seattle airport to visit Allison. On each of those flights I tried to get a right-hand seat on the flight north and a left-hand seat on the flight south, so that I would get to watch the Cascade volcanoes as they passed by my window. It seemed like it would make such a beautiful trip to drive north and ski as many of the volcanoes as possible, but at the time I didn't know how to ski.

Thanks to Tom's timely intervention I got the backcountry skiing bug and with a lot of practice trips up smaller peaks it feels like now is the moment to try and ski all the volcanoes.

Hope you'll follow along!
