We had a blast of warm weather at the beginning of February which Greg, Allison, and I took advantage of to take a quick trip up Mt St Helens. We left on a Friday night and camped out at the trailhead (with the other hundred or so people who were there), then got up around 5am for a 6am departure. Because we were car camping we even got to have our favorite breakfast of coffee yogurt (and blueberries) before leaving.

Pretty soon we were up on the mountain!

I promise I will learn from my mistakes and start recording my videos horizontal instead of vertical... 

We got really lucky with the weather, with beautiful views in all directions and really easy skinning conditions on the way up.
