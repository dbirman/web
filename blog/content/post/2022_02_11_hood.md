The South Side route on Wy'east is at the same time a big step up and a big step down from the mellow skiing on the Worm Flows route of the previous week. You start at a ski lodge, and the first half of the south side route is just skiing up past the lifts. It's a bit disheartening to ski for two hours and realize you could have taken a lift the whole way! In total Wy'east is about +5300' of elevation gain over just 4 miles.

My friend Alex has skied all the volcanoes in Washington state, but he hasn't done Hood even though it's just an hour south of the border with Oregon. We took a day off on a Friday and blasted down the night before, spending the night in the parking lot of the ski lodge. With the clear and cold weather we had beautiful views of the mountain.

I forgot to record some videos and photos while we froze in the early morning wind getting our gera together, but needless to say it was very windy! We got moving pretty fast and an hour later we were hiding behind a boulder waiting for the sun to warm us.
